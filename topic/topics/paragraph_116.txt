In Hebrew and Yiddish, shalom means both hello and good by, as Aloah does in Hawaiian.Shalommeans peace andmeans love, which possibly explains both these uses. The word "contronym" itself, however, probably did not appear until 1962 in the works of Jack Herring.But, let's get back to contronyms. I have nearly 100 of them in my knapsack. Let's provide the reader with a few prime ones:BoltTo hold together (as in mechanical bolting) or to separate by fleeing.ClipTo connect (as with a paper clip) or to detach (as in clipping your hedge).FixTo repair (as in putting together) or to castrate (as in cutting apart).GarnishTo add to (as with food preparation ) or to take away (as with wages).HandicapAn advantage (to insure equality, as in golf) or a disadvantage (that prevents or minimizes equal achievement).Hold upTo support (as in Liberty holding up the torch) or to impede (as in holding up legislation).LeaseTo rent property, or to offer property for rent.OutVisible (as with the moon) or invisible (as with an electric light).SanctionTo approve, or to boycott.ScreenTo present, or to conceal.SkinTo remove (as in skinning an animal for its fur). or to cover.TrimTo decorate (as with a Christmas tree) or to remove excess (as with a mustache).WearTo endure, or to deteriorate.Wind upTo start (as with a clock) or to end (as with a business).I hope the reader has enjoyed this awesome blog on Contronyms, even though, in Old English, it would have been considered "awful."Marv Rubinstein is the author ofThe Compendium Of American EnglishAlso on The Huffington Post:
