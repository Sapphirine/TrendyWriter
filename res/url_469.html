But, you know, as the president himself said, we have an interest in seeing the United Kingdom remain strong, robust, united and an effective partner. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>In at a press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron in June, President Barack Obama said  8220 we obviously have a deep interest in making sure that one of the closest allies that we will ever have remains strong, robust, united, and an effective partner. But ultimately these are decisions that are to be made by the folks there. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>Earnest would not explicitly state that the U.S. opposes the effort to create the first independent Scotland in 307 years, saying  8221  I will certainly respect their right to cast their own ballot without interference from people on the outside. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>Polls paint a conflicting picture leading into Thursday   s ballot, though the voting is expected to be close. The United States has enjoyed a  8220 special relationship 8221  with the United Kingdom since the end of World War II. Earnest said that some elements of the U.S. government were considering the implications of a potential independent Scotland on the relationship.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 I suspect that there&rsquo s somebody at the administration who&rsquo s been thinking about that at some level, 8221  he said.  8220 I don&rsquo t know to what level it has risen. 8221 <\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3379251\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

After eleven months and a notification from a Texas ranger, the ad alleges, &ldquo Abbott does nothing.&rdquo  In 2010, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dallasnews.com\/news\/state\/headlines\/20110209-ex-inmate-may-testify-in-trial-of-former-principal-of-tycs-west-texas-state-school.ece\" target=\"_blank\">West Texas State School,<\/a> a juvenile detention center in Pyote, Texas, closed amid an abuse scandal that involved two former administrators at the center.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo What insider was Greg Abbott covering up for this time?&rdquo  the ad asks.<\/p>\n<p>The Abbott campaign said in a statement Monday that Davis   s allegations  8220 distort the facts. 8221  The campaign says Abbot was  8220 not legally authorized to prosecute the crimes 8221  at the facility until the local District Attorney requested assistance. Abbott   s campaign also cites an AP report that says the case was  8220 quickly taken over 8221  by Abbott after a request was made in 2007. <span style=\"font-size:13px line-height:19px \">The campaign suggests Davis is hoping to distract voters from questions about her <\/span><a style=\"font-size:13px line-height:19px \" href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/govbeat\/wp\/2014\/09\/12\/wendy-davis-campaign-disputes-ethics-complaint-over-book-tour\/\" target=\"_blank\">ethics<\/a><span style=\"font-size:13px line-height:19px \">.  8220 Texans deserve a candidate who puts public service before personal profit, and Sen.

Comparing Johnson   s letter to a more recent presidential text with the same topic &mdash  President Obama   s <a href=\"http:\/\/swampland.time.com\/2013\/04\/17\/president-obamas-speech-on-gun-control-bill-defeat-transcript\/\" target=\"_blank\">speech last April<\/a> after Congress failed to pass the post-Sandy Hook gun control bill &mdash  reveals how much has stayed the same in how politicians talk about guns during the past five decades.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-partner\" data-name=\"rr-partner\"><div class=\"read-more-list\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3340764\/gabrielle-giffords-20-years-vawa\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Gabrielle Giffords: 20 Years After VAWA, There\u2019s Much More Work To Do<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3340464\/little-girl-disappointed-obama-is-not-beyonce\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Girl Tells President She Wished Surprise Guest at School Was Beyonc\u00e9<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/sports\/nfl-creates-team-four-women-combat-domestic-violence-n203706?cid=par-time_20140915\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Playing Defense: Can Four Women Save the NFL From Itself? <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/weather\/hurricane-odile-slams-cabo-san-lucas-leaves-demolished-paradise-n203461?cid=par-time_20140915\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">'Demolished Paradise': Hurricane Slams Celebrity Resort <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/storyline\/isis-terror\/latest-isis-beheading-warning-turkey-stay-out-coalition-n203606?cid=par-time_20140915\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">ISIS Killing a Warning to One Country in Particular <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>The most obvious similarity may be, to modern observers, the most surprising. Mass school shootings, like the one that took place in Newtown, Conn., in December of 2012, are often discussed as a tragedy of our time. Video games are <a href=\"http:\/\/ideas.time.com\/2012\/12\/20\/sandy-hook-shooting-video-games-blamed-again\/\" target=\"_blank\">blamed<\/a>, for example, and few accounts refer to events earlier than 1999   s Columbine massacre. But they   re not actually a 21st-century tragedy: on Aug. 1, 1966, Charles Whitman &mdash  who appeared on the cover of TIME two weeks later &mdash  brought several guns with him to the observation deck of a 307-foot tower at the University of Texas, where he was a student. He killed 13 people and wounded 31 before being shot by police  later, police discovered the bodies of his wife and mother, whom he had killed before coming to campus. The Whitman shooting was the context for Johnson   s urgency when writing to Congress, and that   s the information with which he began his letter.<\/p>\n<p>Then Johnson, like Obama would decades later, clarified that the people the bill in question would affect are people whom nobody wants armed.  8220 There is no excuse, 8221  Johnson wrote, for selling guns to  8220 hardened criminals 8221  and  8220 mental defectives. 8221  Likewise,  8220 we   re talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with severe mental illness, 8221  Obama said.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, both stressed that the bill wouldn   t even change all that much. Here   s Johnson in 1967:  8220 [The bill's]<span class=\"displaytext\"> basic approach is to limit out-of-state purchases and interstate mail order sales of firearms. 8221  Here   s Obama in 2013, with a modern take on mail-order problems:  8220 All [the bill] did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the Internet. 8221  (There was one big change here: while both are concerned with gun-buying by mail, Johnson   s bill was much stricter and would have stopped interstate mail order sales altogether.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"displaytext\"> Then, both appeal to the law-abiding gun owners.  8220 The measure now before Congress is aimed solely at keeping deadly weapons out of the wrong hands. It interferes neither with sportsmen nor law-abiding citizens with a legitimate need. This legislation will impose no real inconvenience on gun buyers, 8221  in 1967, and  8220 Nobody could honestly claim that [the bill] infringed on our Second Amendment rights, 8221  in 2013.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Finally, both end with an appeal to the safety of  8220 the American people 8221  and a call for Congress to act. And for Johnson, at least, it worked: a Gun Control Act <a href=\"http:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/ws\/?pid=29197\" target=\"_blank\">passed<\/a> in 1968.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Read TIME   s 1968 cover story about guns here, in the archive: <\/strong><\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/subscriber\/article\/0,33009,900177,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Gun in America<\/a><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3319341\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"History","slug":"history","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/history\/","description":""},"tag":{"name":"politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/politics\/"},"tags":"Barack Obama|Gun Control|johnson|lbj|Obama|politics","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/lyndon-johnson.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/lyndon-johnson.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/lyndon-johnson.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/lyndon-johnson.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/lyndon-johnson.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"WX\/AP","caption":"President Lyndon Johnson speaks to members of his advisory commission on civil disorders at the group's first meeting on July 29, 1967 at the White House in Washington.

Sanders, an Independent, speak. A progressive group Swinton often works with has rented out his church&rsquo s basement for the event.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&ldquo Hillary seems to be the strongest candidate, and I have a lot of confidence in her leadership,&rdquo  he says, taking a break from setting up chairs. &ldquo I thought her speech today hit all the right notes.&rdquo <\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Swinton&rsquo s political leanings show the uphill battle in store for a politician like Sanders in trying to gain traction in the 2016 Democratic primaries, should he decide to challenge the 800-pound shadow gorilla in the race, the former Secretary of State.<\/p>\n<p>At the 37<sup>th<\/sup> annual Harkin Steak Fry&mdash where Hillary Clinton received the tacit endorsement of Iowa&rsquo s powerful Democratic senator and Steak Fry host Tom Harkin&mdash  earlier Sunday afternoon, a crowd of more than 10,000 roared in approval when she hinted that she may just run again.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo Hi, Iowa,&rdquo  Clinton yelled. &ldquo I&rsquo m baaaack!&rdquo <\/p>\n<p>By contrast, Sanders&rsquo  event was a relatively low-key affair attended by more than 450 people 8211 still a decent crowd, considering the next caucuses are more than 16 months away. Most who showed were left-leaning populists who supported John Edwards in 2008 and consider themselves solidly in the anti-Clinton camp.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo I like the issues Bernie&rsquo s hitting, his anger, because I&rsquo m angry,&rdquo  says Mark Brooks, 62, an Air Force veteran who believes Clinton is too &ldquo corporate&rdquo  to be a good president. &ldquo This isn&rsquo t the country I defended, 8221  he adds.<\/p>\n<p>Sanders&rsquo  message resounded with Brooks. Sanders noted,  8220 We have more people living in poverty than any other time in the history of the United States of America, 8221  touching on 2008-era Edwards&rsquo  populist message on poverty.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo It&rsquo s a crying shame!&rdquo  a man yelled in the audience.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo It is a crying shame,&rdquo  Sanders replied.<\/p>\n<p>Calling for a new jobs program, investment in education and the public funding of elections, Sanders highlights that economic disparity in America has never been greater.<\/p>\n<p>In his speech, Sanders rattles off figures that point to the unfairness that many of his supporters are most concerned about: that top 25 U.S. hedge fund managers made $24 billion last year, or the equivalent of the annual salaries of 450,000 public school teachers. That Walmart is now the largest employer in America while the Walton family, which owns Walmart, possesses as much wealth as the bottom 40% of all earners in America.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo It&rsquo s called indentured servitude!&rdquo  another man yelled&mdash at the top of Sanders    speech, the politician encouraged  8220 small-d 8221  democratic participation, or what other candidates might consider heckling.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo Sometimes, it is,&rdquo  Sanders answered gravely.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, Sanders, who would have to switch parties to run for the Democratic nomination, is Clinton&rsquo s only major competition on the progressive left. But that doesn&rsquo t mean liberals aren&rsquo t hungering for some more competition. Stephen Blobaum, 51, a Des Moines salesman, also caucused for Edwards in 2008. He and his father, Reed Blobaum, 79, came to see Sanders speak and support his fire, but both are holding out hope that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren will make a run.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo She&rsquo s my girlfriend,&rdquo  Reed Blobaum says with a cheeky smile. &ldquo &rsquo We admire what Bernie&rsquo s doing, but she&rsquo s an accomplisher.

They&rsquo re not as disciplined as everybody thinks, 8221  Kerry said on Sept. 5.  8220 They&rsquo re not as organized as everybody thinks. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>So who   s right?<\/p>\n<p>To be sure, nothing grabs attention like the barbaric series of videotaped ISIS beheadings of Westerners, which continued this weekend with the release of footage of the murder of British aid worker David Haines. Such horrors generate a visceral bloodlust, and they have achieved their goal: President Obama declared last week that the U.S. military and its allies are determined to destroy ISIS.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 We have countries in this [Middle East] region, countries outside of this region, in addition to the United States, all of whom are prepared to engage in military assistance, in actual strikes, if that is what is required,&rdquo  Kerry said Sunday on CBS&rsquo s <em>Face the Nation<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>There   s a parallel to al-Qaeda here. Both Sunni groups leapt to prominence only after attacking the West with its own weapons. Al-Qaeda did it with airliners  ISIS has done it with the intrepid journalists and aid workers they captured and then murdered. Their chosen tools highlight how impotent they actually are.<\/p>\n<p>That became even clearer last week when the Pentagon released its first comprehensive accounting of the ISIS targets it has hit in its month-long series of more than 150 air strikes.<\/p>\n<p>The single largest category &mdash  88 of 212 individual targets, or 42% &mdash  is  8220 armed vehicles. 8221  Not  8220 armored vehicles, 8221  like a tank or personnel carrier, but civilian pickups with machine guns mounted in the rear. A pair of tanks and assorted other armor accounts for a scant 7% of the targets.<\/p>\n<p>Roughly 10% are antiaircraft artillery and locations described as  8220 IED Emplacements, Mortar Positions, [and] Machine Gun Locations. 8221  The  8220 facilities 8221  on Central Command   s hit list include  8220 Fighting Positions, Checkpoints [and] Observation Posts. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>This is not an arsenal, but a ragtag collection, including gear the U.S. supplied to the Iraqi army, which ISIS seized after driving Iraqi forces from Mosul (the U.S. has attacked 37 ISIS Humvees built in Mishawaka, Ind.).<\/p>\n<p>Of course, foes don   t need huge and costly weapons to be effective. The 9\/11 hijackers murdered over 3,000 armed with nothing more than $2 box cutters. But they did that by exploiting yawning vulnerabilities in commercial-aviation security. The terrorists    caginess must be trumped by wily thinking by the U.S. and its allies, a strategy in which air strikes can only play a supporting role.<\/p>\n<p>Paltry gear shouldn   t been viewed as evidence of ISIS    inherent weakness. It is waging war on a far broader battlefield than that being attacked by U.S. warplanes. That means it cannot be defeated by military means alone. Until the underlying causes for ISIS   s rise &mdash  the anti-Sunni governments in Iraq and Syria chief among them &mdash  are dealt with, ISIS will pose a real threat to the civilized world.<\/p>\n<p>But it   s also important to realize that ISIS has succeeded only where it has been unopposed. Its proclaimed state is in the middle of one of the world   s most-heavily-armed regions, and it has shown little ability or desire to challenge a motivated military force.<\/p>\n<p>They say nature abhors a vacuum. So do terrorists, judging by the CIA   s assessment Thursday that ISIS has grown from 10,000 to as many as 31,500 fighters over the summer, owing in no small part to its military success. They   re eager to plant their black flags in ungoverned terrain. That the West permitted such a fertile field in which ISIS could take root &mdash  in fact, all but plowed and sowed it &mdash  is the real harvest of the Iraq War.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"2\"><object id=\"bc-video-3769770595001-2\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1pfPbTB\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3769770595001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-337 28\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

But I feel he&rsquo s been pushed aside.&rdquo <\/p>\n<p>All three came to the Steak Fry this year to see Clinton speak on her first trip back to Iowa since her 2008 caucus loss. Bethany says she&rsquo ll caucus for Clinton in 2016, if she runs. But Rosemary is dubious. &ldquo I don&rsquo t think America is ready,&rdquo  she says. &ldquo There&rsquo s a lot of people who won&rsquo t vote for her because she&rsquo s a woman. Like Barack Obama, the first African American, when he got elected, but Congress wouldn&rsquo t work with him.&rdquo <\/p>\n<p>Amanda, twirling her fork pensively in her potato salad, chimes in: &ldquo And if you think that, than there are 100,000 people who think it,&rdquo  she says. &ldquo Well, if you say that it becomes true,&rdquo  Bethany counters. &ldquo We have to believe and work to make that not true.&rdquo  Her mother and sister shrug, clearly not moved to action.<\/p>\n<p>Clinton&rsquo s candidacy is still a figment of Bethany   s &mdash  and most of the national media&rsquo s &mdash  imagination. But that hasn&rsquo t stopped widespread speculation that Clinton   s visit to the Harkin event represents the unofficial kickoff of her 2016 run. Her shadow campaign, &ldquo Ready for Hillary,&rdquo  has parked a bus emblazoned with its logo outside the Steak Fry and volunteers are waiting five deep to sign up.<\/p>\n<p>The Steak Fry has a carnival-like atmosphere. Iowans in droves wear T-shirts colored for their favorite state and local candidates. By far the most T-shirts are light blue with a simply stated,  8220 Ready 8221  on them &mdash  shorthand for  8220 Ready for Hillary. 8221  Attendees carry coolers of beer and lemonade and lay out blankets on the slightly damp ground. They sing along to Bruce Springsteen&rsquo s &ldquo Born in the U.S.A.,&rdquo  as they wait for the show to begin.<\/p>\n<p>As is his prerogative on his big day, Harkin is keeping his own schedule. He is retiring and this will be his final Steak Fry. The event is a far cry from the 52 people who attended the first one in 1972. The largest year yet, 2007, saw more than 10,000 people arrive to watch Clinton and then rivals Barack Obama and John Edwards. This year, Harkin and the Clintons arrive from a morning event in Des Moines with 450 Harkin donors 20 minutes after the speaking schedule was due to begin. But they take their time, eating lunch, as Harkin always does, before greeting the press and flipping the traditional steak for the assembled cameras. More than 200 reporters from around the world are present to witness potential history.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo Are you running?&rdquo  reporters repeatedly shout at Hillary. She demurs. She even pretends not to notice when, the event having finally started down the hill, a speaker starts asking the crowd: &ldquo Are you fired up? Are you ready to go? Are you ready for Hillary? ARE YOU READY FOR HILLARY?&rdquo  he screams as the crowd roars.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 Are you ready, Hillary? 8221  a reporter yells. She ignores all this and chats away with Harkin and his wife Ruth. Her husband can be heard saying:  8220 As long as I   m still married to her, I   m doing good. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>After Harkin introduces the Clintons as the  8220 comeback couple, 8221  Hillary takes the stage to chants of her name.  8220 Wow! 8221  she says.  8220 Hello Iowa. I   m baaaaack! 8221  &mdash  a line <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PirVtiJuvDs\" target=\"_blank\">made famous<\/a> by the movie <em>Independence Day<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>As the crowd cheers and whistles, Clinton says she has a lot to look forward to these days.  8220 First, Bill and I are on constant grandchild watch  8230  So don   t be surprised if we suddenly go sprinting off the stage. 8221 <\/p>\n<p> 8220 And then of course there   s that other thing, 8221  she adds, to a standing ovation.  8220 Well it is true, I am thinking about it. But for today, that is not why I   m here, 8221  she says.<\/p>\n<p>The crowd expresses disapproval at this.  8220 I   m here for the steak! 8221  she says, which gets them cheering again.  8220 For years I was more likely to be eating yak meat in Mongolia, and enjoying it, but thinking a lot of being back home. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>It   s all red meat for the  8220 Ready for Hillary 8221  crowd, of course. But others say her election to the presidency isn   t a sure thing. Carter Bell, 20, president of the University of Iowa Democrats, says she likes what she&rsquo s hearing from Clinton, but she&rsquo s keeping an open mind for the 2016 caucuses. &ldquo I like [Vice President] Joe Biden a lot too. And I&rsquo ve met [Maryland Governor] Martin O&rsquo Malley a bunch of times as he&rsquo s been out here a lot,&rdquo  she says. &ldquo And I love Elizabeth Warren, she&rsquo s great, but she may not run.&rdquo  Bell says Clinton will have to do some work to earn her support.<\/p>\n<p>Sitting on a beach chair nearby, Judy Keller, 66, Des Moines consumer-affairs representative, is convinced. She says she regrets supporting John Edwards in 2008. &ldquo I didn&rsquo t know that she   d have a chance in &rsquo 08,&rdquo  she says. &ldquo  I thought a man would win. But now it&rsquo s time. It&rsquo s time for a woman. I won   t make the same mistake twice.&rdquo <\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3373772\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

And that   s exactly what success looks like.&rdquo <\/p>\n<p>The comments came days after President Barack Obama set a tall order for the U.S. in his address to the nation on Wednesday, pledging to &ldquo degrade and ultimately destroy&rdquo  the militant group. But in public statements and closed-door comments, his Administration is putting more emphasis on the first verb.<\/p>\n<p>For Obama, the risk is a familiar one: overpromising and underdelivering. In 2012, Obama set a &ldquo red line&rdquo  in Syria, suggesting he&rsquo d use air strikes in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, a standard he repeatedly shifted throughout 2013.<\/p>\n<p>For months this summer, the Obama Administration had set its goal on containing the threat of ISIS, but a combination of factors, including public outcry and congressional uproar over the brutal killing of two American journalists, has led the White House to escalate its rhetoric. But the harsher tone hasn&rsquo t meant a change in the underlying aims.<\/p>\n<p>Obama first embraced the &ldquo degrade and destroy&rdquo  formulation in a convoluted press conference in Estonia a day after ISIS released a video of the beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff. But the operative lines were his admission that the group could never truly be eradicated. &ldquo As we&rsquo ve seen with al-Qaeda, there are always going to be remnants that can cause havoc of any of these networks, in part because of the nature of terrorist activities,&rdquo  Obama said. &ldquo You get a few individuals, and they may be able to carry out a terrorist act.&rdquo <\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3373178\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

And that is a good thing. There is no foreign policy consensus today  in fact, there is barely any foreign policy coherence. The Republicans veer wildly from the interventionism of John McCain to the isolationism of Rand Paul. On the Democratic side, Hilary Clinton is dismissive of the President&rsquo s foreign policy positions but seems to have none of her own. Yet amidst this confusion, the President spoke wisely and well, and I heard in his words some of the clarity, depth, and moral power that characterize the writings of his &ldquo favorite philosopher.&rdquo <\/p>\n<p>A liberal clergyman, Niebuhr wrote forcefully about original sin and the existence of evil in the world. Setting aside the pacifism of his youth, he came to believe that liberal reformers too often exaggerate human goodness. And since nations are even more flawed than individuals, he saw power politics as inevitable. This meant that if justice were to be achieved in this world, America would have to be prepared to exercise the power that she possesses. For great nations in a messy world, there is no opting out  great powers must take chances and get their hands dirty in order to do right.<\/p>\n<p>In this vein, the President was specific about the evil that is ISIS  he spoke of the attempted genocide, the mass executions, the abuse of women, and the killing of children. He mentioned the gruesome beheadings of American journalists. And he spoke as well of America&rsquo s obligation to lead in the world and to promote both justice and freedom, and did so with more passion than has been his custom of late.<\/p>\n<p>But there is another side to Niebuhr, and there was another side to the President&rsquo s speech. Niebuhr affirmed power but also feared it. While individuals are sometimes humble, he believed that nations&mdash and especially great powers&mdash never are. They assume that they can change the world in ways they cannot. They act for their own benefit rather than for the benefit of those they are supposedly helping. They deify their own states and their own intentions. They fail to ask if what they are undertaking will help or hurt. And they do all of this, often, with the very best of intentions, certain of their own virtue. And the result? Tragedies such as Vietnam, where American pretensions led not to the justice that Americans aspired to but to suffering and disaster.<\/p>\n<p>The President, it seemed to me, was clearly aware of the dangers of overreach, and he did a reasonably good job, to use David Brooks&rsquo  phrase, of &ldquo thread(ing) the Niebuhrian needle.&rdquo  He talked about things that America can reasonably expect to accomplish, such as air strikes on ISIS targets and delivering humanitarian aid. He avoided the temptation to inflate the threat of terrorism, even as he pledged to keep America safe. And he refrained from the language of jingoism and belligerence to which such occasions lend themselves. And above all, he made a firm commitment that American troops would not fight a battle that, if it is to be won, must be fought by Arab armies. In short, the President more or less succeeded in balancing American assertiveness with the humility that Niebuhr prized as the essential&mdash and usually the missing&mdash ingredient of American foreign policy.<\/p>\n<p>And this too: Niebuhr was an enthusiastic champion of the checks and balances of the Constitution. He was reassured by the idea that each branch of government would ride herd on the others and thereby prevent abuses of power in pursuing foreign adventures. Here too the President got it right in calling for the full and robust engagement of the Congress in authorizing and shaping the campaign against ISIS.<\/p>\n<p>I have no doubt that the President will be subjected to a barrage of criticism from the warmongering elements of the opposition, but I find his performance impressive. The American people needed to hear a plan, and they did  they needed to be reassured, and they were. And they needed to know, as they now do, that their government will not rush off and engage us in a battle that will exacerbate rather than calm the deeply troubled waters of the Middle East, taking many American lives in the process.<\/p>\n<p>What would Reinhold Niebuhr say? I can only speculate. He died in 1971, and we will never know what he would say or do. But my guess is that the President was paying attention to his teachings, and the great theologian would be pleased.<\/p>\n<p><em>Rabbi Eric H.

My honest answer is that it&rsquo s a mixed bag. On the negative side, I have to say that the reactions of people who liked me better when I still had faith have been at times very strong. I usually become a target for re-evangelism for a while, but they eventually learn to quit pushing me after they realize that I&rsquo ve heard everything they have to say about this a thousand times. Most people probably just decide I&rsquo m being stubborn and\/or that the Devil&rsquo s got me under a spell  but while the pushing may stop, the disappointment lingers on. Some do their best to keep a lid on that, which I appreciate, but you can still hear it in their voices and that can hurt. If you crave the approval of people, and if you live where I live, I wouldn&rsquo t recommend atheism for you.<\/p>\n<p>But once you rule out how some have behaved toward me because of my unbelief, I have to say that (when I am not working too much) I am enjoying life in a way that I haven&rsquo t enjoyed it in a long time. It&rsquo s not always about what I&rsquo m doing at the time, either. Often it&rsquo s just about <em>feeling more at home in my own skin<\/em> than I ever felt when I still believed that Earth is not my home and that I&rsquo m supposed to be longing for some other place. To explain what I mean, here is a list of the things which leaving my religion has brought me. Not everyone will necessarily experience the same things I did, but these are the benefits that I see I personally have derived from this development:<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>1. Peace of mind<\/strong>.<\/em> As a person who likes to try to understand the world around me, I have found that this perspective fits so much better with the world I see than the religious perspective ever did, and that brings a tangible sense of satisfaction for me. Every week, every month, I find things seem to get clearer and clearer to me. Things just make a whole lot more sense to me now. Julia Sweeney said it perfectly when she said, &ldquo The world behaves exactly as you would expect it would if there were no Supreme Being.&rdquo  I don&rsquo t mean that I understand everything, and I&rsquo ve still got plenty of unanswered questions. But you don&rsquo t have to be ruled by your need to have answers to all your questions. I think our religions feed that problem in order to perpetuate our need for them. Leaving your religion can free you up to find better answers to some questions while enabling you to let go of the ones that don&rsquo t really have good answers.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>2. A rediscovery of a love of learning<\/strong>.<\/em> For me personally, I found that the loss of my religious beliefs opened me up to a really big universe of fascinating and intriguing realities. I realize that faith and learning coexist in some people&rsquo s minds better than others, but more often than not they are in great tension with one another, and <em>at times they are diametrically opposed to one another<\/em>. My change of mind energized my dormant scientific side, and as a consequence I find that almost daily I learn something new which amazes me and further stimulates my love of learning about the world around me.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>3. The ability to accept people I formerly judged<\/strong>.<\/em> Religious belief taught me, for example, to judge the LGBT community for being attracted to anything other than &ldquo the appropriate sex.&rdquo  It taught me that something is wrong with these people, and while it also taught me I&rsquo m supposed to love them and somehow accept them and reach out to them, I&rsquo m also supposed to condemn something that lies at the core of their identity. That&rsquo s no longer an issue for me. The main reason most people I know condemn same-sex relationships is because of their religion. Leaving your religion can free you from that burden. I now count several of them as my most supportive friends. In fact, I have found that losing my religion has opened me up to a much wider range of people because I do not have a 2,000 year old book telling me how I should see the world. I think I&rsquo m a better person for this change of mind.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>4. Less judgement toward myself&hellip for some things<\/strong>.<\/em> Just as a loss of religion has made me more accepting of others, I am getting better at accepting myself, with certain caveats. I do not let myself off the hook for things I consider unhealthy, or unkind, or inconsiderate of others. There are good, non-religious reasons to work to eliminate those kinds of behaviors in life. I will not, for example let myself off the hook for being dishonest toward people, nor will I excuse substandard work in my professional life. But there are quite a few things which my religion taught me I should feel guilty about, and I don&rsquo t have to shoulder that anymore. This brings an improved quality of life. I will not consider it wicked, for example, to have &ldquo thought crimes&rdquo  such as wanting something I don&rsquo t have or savoring the attractiveness of another person. Religion puts many layers of guilt on us for things which are perfectly natural, and the resulting manipulation is powerful. But I&rsquo m done with that now. The self-loathing and guilt my religion taught me was in retrospect incredibly unhealthy. It takes time to unlearn the negative self-talk. But once you&rsquo ve made some progress in letting that go, you can become a much happier person.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>5. I give credit where credit is due, both to others and to myself<\/strong>.<\/em> Like the preceding two, I think this makes me a healthier person than before. If someone does something good, I do not thank God for it. <em>I thank the person who actually did it<\/em>. They deserve credit for the things that they do. Doctors, for example, must get really tired of hearing people give God credit when their surgical\/medical skills and learning are what saved a person&rsquo s life. My daily life isn&rsquo t so dramatic as that, mind you, but it&rsquo s analogous. The other side of this is that when I do something right, I allow myself to take credit for it. This, thanks to my evangelical upbringing, is <em>much<\/em> harder to do. I found that the Christian faith discouraged me from acknowledging positive things about myself so that I ended up with a terrible self image. I still suffer from that because I learned self-loathing so very well. But it&rsquo s getting better, little by little. I had to leave the Christian faith for that to happen.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>6. Getting Sunday mornings back<\/strong>.<\/em> Of course, it extends beyond that once you consider how much of a person&rsquo s life can be spent investing in things like prayer, worship, Bible study, witnessing\/growing membership, or attending conferences which teach you how to do all these things more effectively. After you give those things up, you realize just how much of your life you get back. I never resented my religion for the amount of my time and effort it took up. I enjoyed it at the time because I believed all of it was pleasing to God and that&rsquo s all I wanted in life. But now that I&rsquo ve &ldquo given up the ghost&rdquo  so to speak, I see that there are so many other valuable things toward which I could be devoting my time and energy.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>7. Better health<\/strong>.<\/em> I realize good health and spiritual commitment don&rsquo t have to be mutually exclusive, but for me personally a shift in beliefs brought a shift in priorities such that my physical health became more important to me. Now I feel better than I&rsquo ve ever felt in my life, and this significantly affects the quality of my life. Just yesterday I ran another one of those mud runs with some friends in another state and I had a blast. I hope to write a few thoughts and observations about that soon.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>8. Better sex.<\/em> <\/strong>You wouldn&rsquo t believe how much more you can enjoy sex once you let go of the subtle (or often not-so-subtle) body shame that accompanies religious devotion. I know a number of couples who once were devout Christians and now are both non-believers, and almost without exception they have reported an improvement in their sex lives. It&rsquo s not that religion always directly shames people for their desires and their pleasures. But the Christian faith in particular <a class=\"ext-link\" title=\"Sex and Christianity Make Strange Bedfellows\" href=\"http:\/\/admin.patheos.com\/blogs\/godlessindixie\/2013\/11\/29\/sex-and-christianity-make-strange-bedfellows\/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">teaches you<\/a> never to be totally at home in your own body. It talks as if you belong somewhere else, and this just isn&rsquo t compatible with fully embracing your own physical existence the way that really good sex requires.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>9. Friends who are more fun.<\/strong><\/em> And the parties are way better. Even simple conversation is more entertaining, honestly. I know this may sound petty, but I&rsquo m just telling you what my experience is. When group A is dominated by a long list of things you&rsquo re not supposed to say, think, or feel, and group B doesn&rsquo t have that list, you can guess which group is gonna be more fun to be with. And again, I find it easier now to be friends with a wider range of people.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>10. More realistic expectations about life.<\/strong><\/em> I no longer believe that I am special or that a ubiquitous, all-powerful paternal figure is orchestrating events around me for my benefit (or for the benefit of anything or anyone, really). So I act accordingly. And I find that I don&rsquo t get let down by things not going &ldquo the way they were supposed to.&rdquo  I take responsibility for those things I can control, and I don&rsquo t look for a savior to come and rescue me. Again, I think I am a better person for it.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>11. A greater appreciation for the preciousness of life.<\/strong><\/em> Once you realize this life is the only one you&rsquo re gonna get, you learn to appreciate each day in a way you never could when you believed there would be trillions more in your future. I found that a belief in eternity only lowered my evaluation of daily life and it cheapened life, in a way. But once you realize this one short life is all you&rsquo re going to get, you will find it easier to throw yourself into what you do, knowing that you need to make the most of it that you can. You won&rsquo t minimize the suffering of others (or of yourself) by saying that life will get better <em>after you die<\/em>. You might even be more motivated to be an agent of change in the world once you realize someone&rsquo s not going to come in and magically reboot the whole thing one day. It&rsquo s up to us to make the most of our one life that we can, and I find that a disbelief in the supernatural has helped me to do that.<\/p>\n<p>What things could you add to this list? How has leaving your religion benefited your life?
