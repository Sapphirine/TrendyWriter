			<b>Kris Kobach: a man with a mission</b><br />
<br />
by digby<br />
<br />
My piece for Salon today tackles yet another "vote fraud" fraud --- the Kansas Secretary of State, Kris Kobach:<br />
<blockquote>
Following up on <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/12/its_disgusting_and_its_still_about_race_southern_republicans_simply_dont_want_minorities_to_vote/">my post</a> on Friday about the long illustrious history of conservative vote suppression it’s interesting that one of the nation’s foremost activists in the field should be in the spotlight going into the November election. Indeed, he’s right in the middle of one of the most interesting races in the country.<br />
<br />
I’m referring to Kris Kobach, the Republican Kansas Secretary of State who was sued last week by the former Democratic candidate for the Senate who dropped out of the race in favor of an independent. If you haven’t heard about this wild turn of events, in a nutshell, the Kansas GOP is imploding under <a href="http://www.alternet.org/what-happened-when-extremist-christian-fundamentalist-got-run-whole-state">the disastrous leadership of the ultra-conservative Governor Sam Brownback.</a> It’s so bad that GOP leaders in the state are defecting from the party and it looks as though a former Democrat-turned-independent may just <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/pat-roberts-kansas-2014-election-110822.html">unseat long term Republican incumbent Pat Roberts.</a> Seeing the opening for an upset, the Democrats in the state persuaded their candidate to drop out and he agreed to do it. He followed all the rules for withdrawal but Kobach’s office says no dice: you’re staying on the ballot whether you want to run or not.</blockquote>
<br />
Koback is a real piece of work --- the guy who helped the notorious Russell Pierce draft Arizona's AB 1070. Needless to say he's doing everything in his power to insure that the Kansas GOP's rebellion isn't successful. He's just the kin of Republican a lot of these folks are getting tired of.<br />

			<b>Looks like Rand Paul's a thumbs up on war</b><br />
<br />
by digby<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/rand-paul-foreign-policy-110953.html#ixzz3DPA4n4sj">But he's adamant</a>, damn it, that the congress should vote to keep it going more often than it has in the past. Here's the king of the process dodge brushing over the fact that he's going to vote for war by pretending that it's more important that he insures that the congress keeps rubber stamping it: <br />
<br />
<blockquote>Appearing on CBS “This Morning,” the Kentucky Republican conceded that he has shifted his views in some areas, including on what is an appropriate U.S. response to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. “As world events change, obviously you change your analysis. Five years ago, ISIS wasn’t a threat,” he said, using an alternate name for the terrorist group that has mobilized across much of northern and central Iraq.<br />
<br />
Paul acknowledged that his thought process on ISIL has been “influenced” by ISIL’s recent beheadings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines.<br />
[...]<br />
Paul said on Fox News on Monday that because opinions change over time, depending on circumstances, if a vote of whether to go to war against ISIL would make it to Congress, he would vote to “limit the authorization to a time period.”<br />
<br />
“I would try to sunset the provision,” Paul said. “I’ve been upset that we voted 15 years ago and people are still using a vote from 15 years ago, so I think if we authorize force or declare war, it should sunset at the end of the year and we should vote again, because I don’t like the idea that one generation can vote to bind another generation to war forever.”</blockquote><br />
Notice he doesn't say he will vote against it.  Indeed, it's fairly clear that he's on board. You see, the really upsetting part of the 15 year war we've been waging is the <i>authorization procedures</i>.  The war itself? Not a problem, apparently. <br />
<br />
Oh well, there's always Justin Amash. <br />
<br />
<br />
*It must be pointed out that the DNC is portraying Paul's wavering as proof that he's <i>insufficiently hawkish</i>, so he has that going for him. <br>

<br />
by digby<br />
<br />
<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/09/15/3567 2/russell-pearce-welfare-sterlization/">Out of the mouth </a>of Russell Pearce, vice chair of the Arizona Republican party and the mover and shaker behind Arizona's odious SB 1070:<br />
<blockquote>
“You put me in charge of Medicaid, the first thing I’d do is get Norplant, birth-control implants, or tubal ligations. Then, we’ll test recipients for drugs and alcohol, and if you want to [reproduce] or use drugs or alcohol, then get a job.”</blockquote>
They actually made him resign.  Finally. Apparently you can go too far even for Arizona Republicans to tolerate. <br />
<br />
But as Bryce Covert at&nbsp <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/09/15/3567 2/russell-pearce-welfare-sterlization/">Think Progress points out</a>, these sentiments have been informing conservative and centrist policy on this for decades:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
The Nixon administration pushed through funding for serializations in the 1970s aimed mostly a low-income people, usually women of color, and many were done involuntarily. And while it may sound like long-ago history, the practice of sterilizing low-income women hasn’t been entirely done away with. Between 2005 and 2013,   tubal ligations were given to women in California’s prison system without full consent. The majority of those were performed by Dr. James Heinrich, who has said of the practice, “Over a ten-year period, that isn’t a huge amount of money compared to what you save in welfare paying for these unwanted children — as they procreated more.” The state is now considering banning inmate sterilization.<br />
<br />
In the absence of outright sterilization, there are other policies that rely on the ugly idea that low-income women need to be stopped from having children. While in most states, families receive more welfare benefits when they have additional children, 16 have family caps that ban any extra money for new children if someone in the household is already receiving aid. There’s no evidence that these policies keep women from having more children, as they are intended to do, but there is evidence that they push people further into poverty and can lead to higher death rates.</blockquote>
<br />
You have to love the fact that conservatives who are now arguing against birth control (all the way up to the Supreme Court) and want to ban abortion for everyone are also people who want to require contraception or forcibly sterilize poor women. It kind of shines a light on their real intentions doesn't it? <br />
<br />
Of course it isn't just Republicans. Democrats made a whole lot of noise about "welfare reform" during the 90s, with the sub-text always being that women on welfare we being encouraged to have "too many children" and they needed to "go to work." They shouldn't be let off the hook. It was as opportunistic in its way as the Southern Strategy was for Republicans.  <br />

			<p><b>Peek-a-boo, we spy you</b></p><p>
by Tom Sullivan</p><p>

Why don't the spy agencies just give their next eavesdropping program a name like "Big Brother" and be done with it? Der Spiegel began its weekend <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/snowden-documents-indicate-nsa-has-breached-deutsche-telekom-a-991503.html">report</a> on the hacking of Deutsche Telekom with the cutsey names British and American spooks give to various Internet snooping programs: "Evil Olive" or "Egoistic Giraffe." Or the Johnny Depp-ish "Treasure Map," with a logo featuring a skull with glowing eye holes. [Emphasis mine.]</p>

<blockquote><p>Treasure Map is anything but harmless entertainment. Rather, it is the mandate for a massive raid on the digital world. It aims to map the Internet, and not just the large traffic channels, such as telecommunications cables. It also seeks to identify the devices across which our data flows, so-called routers.</p><p>

Furthermore, <b>every single end device that is connected to the Internet somewhere in the world -- every smartphone, tablet and computer -- is to be made visible</b>. Such a map doesn't just reveal one treasure. There are millions of them.</p></blockquote>

Soon, they'll teach your smartphone to bark out commands and lead you in morning calisthenics:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Smith! 6079 Smith W.! Yes, you! Bend lower, please! You can do better than that. You're not trying. Lower, please! That's better, comrade."</i></blockquote>

<p>But before getting to that, according documents from Britain's GCHQ leaked by Edward Snowden, the plan is to map out the entire geography of the worldwide Internet. And not just the hardware.</p>

<blockquote>Treasure Map allows for the creation of an "interactive map of the global Internet" in "near real-time," the document notes. Employees of the so-called "FiveEyes" intelligence agencies from Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which cooperate closely with the American agency NSA, can install and use the program on their own computers. One can imagine it as a kind of Google Earth for global data traffic, a bird's eye view of the planet's digital arteries.</blockquote><p>Unless your are Angela Merkel, the spying revealed by Snowden has, for the most part, always seemed abstract, theoretical. Here, it gets personal. Der Spiegel reviewed some of the Snowden documents with staff from a German telecom, Stellar. In Der Spiegel's video (watch it <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/snowden-documents-indicate-nsa-has-breached-deutsche-telekom-a-991503.html">here</a>), we see the engineers "visibly shocked" as they realize not only have their systems been hacked and client passwords compromised, but key engineers sitting in the room have been "tasked" for surveillance because of their level of access to the network. Pointing to a name in one of the Treasure Map documents, the reporter says, "That's you," to the stunned guy sitting across the table. The security breach, the engineer explains, would allow the spy agency to remotely see "the exact point on the globe that a customer is located."</p><p>  

Don't you feel safer knowing you're paying the salaries of the Americans doing the same? That they work for you?</p><br>

I think it's great that they explain that Centcom stands or US Central Command.  But it probably would have been even more helpful if they explained that "aggressive kinetic action" means --- war.<br />

“I will not let this president suggest to the American people we can outsource our security and this is not about our safety!” he said.</blockquote>Remember, most villagers consider Graham a moderate.  Really.<br />

So Fox news is having a hissy fit over <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/2014/09/14/vermont-bans-brownies-turns-kids-kale-gluten-free-paleo-lemon-bars">this</a>, naturally. (Sorry didn't mean to offend by using the word "natural.")<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Vermont Bans Brownies, Turns Kids On To Kale, Gluten-Free Paleo Lemon Bars<br />
<br />
It’s a best-seller at bake sales, a king of American confections, even a mandatory munchie of marijuana users. But the iconic chocolate brownie, that perfect blend of cake and cookie, is banned in Vermont schools.<br />
<br />
In its place are new hoped-for kid favorites like fruit shish kebab, kale and even gluten-free paleo lemon bars.<br />
<br />
The switch stems from nutrition mandates required under the new Smart-Snacks-in-Schools program in effect for public schools.<br />
<br />
“The new school lunch pattern has low-fat, leaner proteins, greater variety and larger portions of fruits and vegetables  the grains have to be 100 percent whole-grain rich,” Laurie Colgan, child nutrition program director at the Agency of Education, told Vermont Watchdog.</blockquote><br />
The article goes on to explain that the rules only apply to fundraising held between midnight and half and hour after school and that it doesn't ban brownies, just the disgusting masses of chemical glop that most people <i>call</i> brownies. <br />
<br />
You see, it's perfectly possible to make a brownie from something other than a box.  And if you do that you can control the ingredients and make the brownies comply with the guidelines.  Oh, and the kids will still like them, I guarantee it. In fact once upon a time people used to make all kinds of treats from scratch to sell at school bake sales.  And they didn't have fancy food processors and mixers to help. They tasted good. Really good. <br />
<br />
Being a little smarmy and nannyish <i>with kids</i> is an adult's responsibility.  Sure, if <i>you</i> want to eat bowls full of raw brownie mix that's made from plastic, as an adult that's your right. But when did we decide that kids have some God-given or constitutional right to eat as much junk food as they want to and anyone who says otherwise is some kind of commie? It's just weird. <br />
<br />
I guess these right wingers are the real believers in the "if it feels good, do it" school, and don't want their children to be deprived of even the tiniest bit of sugary, transfat laden garbage or exhorted to eat something green that isn't called a Shamrock shake. Party on dudes. <br />

			<b>Nice little rights you have there... BASIAHTT</b><br />
<b><br />
</b> by digby<br />
<br />
I'm a coward so if the police ask me for ID I'm going to give it to them even though in California it's not legally required if they have no good reason to ask. (When you're driving you do have to.) Until recently I didn't even carry my ID if I was walking at the beach, as I do every night. But my husband was stopped a while back by LAPD on the Venice boardwalk and got detained for an hour and rousted pretty rudely because he didn't have his driver's license on him. (There was a report of a middle aged homeless man sleeping in someone's garage in the neighborhood who was wearing jeans and a blue hoodie --- like my husband. Like a thousand other people on the boardwalk that day ...)<br />
<br />
Anyway, since then, I've always carried my ID with me. And it irks me that I have to. I wish I was brave enough to face down armed police and assert my rights but I'm not. I'm not brave enough argue with an armed gang member either and the hostile, aggressive way these interactions happen feel very similar.  The smart move in both cases is to keep your head down, do as you're told and hope you get out of there unscathed because if either cops or gang members want to exercise their power over you they can mess up your life --- even take it. (Of course police are just as likely to use a little electro-shock ultra violence on you to make sure you comply, but you won't die from that. Probably.)<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2755113/Django-Unchained-actress-claims-handcuffed-detained-police-mistaken-prostitute-kissed-husband.html?ito=social-facebook">Here's someone</a> who took the more difficult path and got herself handcuffed and harrassed. Why? She was a black woman kissing her white boyfriend, fully clothed, in their car:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>A Django Unchained actress is claiming she was 'handcuffed and detained' by police after being mistaken for a prostitute as she kissed her white husband.<br />
<br />
Daniele Watts, who played slave CoCo in the award-winning film, posted the news on her Facebook page on 2 September and said her arm was cut when she was handcuffed.<br />
<br />
Watts and her husband Brian James Lucas claim that they were kissing on a Hollywood street when police were called and they were asked to show their ID card to which Watts refused.<br />
<br />
Watts wrote on her Facebook page: 'Today I was handcuffed and detained by 2 police officers from the Studio City Police Department after refusing to agree that I had done something wrong by showing affection, fully clothed, in a public place.'<br />
<br />
She also posted a photo of crying as she stood in the street wearing patterned shorts, a t-shirt with 'New York' written on it and running shoes with a  policeman next to her.<br />
<br />
Watts, who plays Martin Lawrence's daughter on the new FX comedy Partners, continued: 'When the officer arrived, I was standing on the sidewalk by a tree.<br />
<br />
'I was talking to my father on my cell phone.<br />
<br />
'I knew that I had done nothing wrong, that I wasn't harming anyone, so I walked away.<br />
<br />
'A few minutes later, I was still talking to my dad when 2 different police officers accosted me and forced me into handcuffs.<br />
<br />
'As I was sitting in the back of the police car, I remembered the countless times my father came home frustrated or humiliated by the cops when he had done nothing wrong.<br />
 <br />
'I allowed myself to be honest about my anger, frustration, and rage as tears flowed from my eyes.<br />
<br />
'The tears I cry for a country that calls itself 'the land of the free and the home of the brave' and yet detains people for claiming that very right. <br />
<br />
Separately her chef husband posted on his Facebook page that he thought that the person who called the police had decided they looked like a prostitute and a client. <br />
<br />
He wrote: 'From the questions that he asked me as D was already on her phone with her dad, I could tell that whoever called on us (including the officers), saw a tatted RAWKer white boy and a hot bootie shorted black girl and thought we were a H* (prostitute) & a TRICK (client). <br />
'What an assumption to make!!!Because of my past experience with the law, I gave him my ID knowing we did nothing wrong and when they asked D for hers, she refused to give it because they had no right to do so.<br />
<br />
'So they handcuffed her and threw her roughly into the back of the cop car until they could figure out who she was. In the process of handcuffing her, they cut her wrist, which was truly NOT COOL!!!'<br />
<br />
An LAPD public information officer said there was no record of the incident as Watts was not arrested or brought into the station for questioning, according to the Chicago Tribune.</blockquote><br />
There are pictures, so it happened. The question is why the police needed to do anything in that situation? Once they talked to both of them it should have been clear that no law was being broken.  Her refusing to give her ID was irrelevant at that stage. They simply decided they needed to know who she was --- just in case there was some reason they needed to know who she was. That's not legal. <br />
<br />
Anyway, the.story made me embarrassed. Here I am a privileged older white woman being afraid to challenge police.  I can't imagine how much courage it takes to be African American and do it. My God that's brave. My hat's off to her and others who are willing to take a stand. That's real patriotism in my book. <br />

I think <a href="http://www.bitlanders.com/movie/to-kill-an-american/36884">this is a </a>nice video(&nbsp from Matthew Modine, whose heart is in the right place. The "idea" of America <i>is</i> an egalitarian, multi-cultural, democratic society where everyone is free to pursue their happiness --- at least for many people. &nbsp Let's not forget that there are also Americans who believe this is an explicitly Christian country or those who think that our culture is being polluted by immigrants. Among other things.) We are a varied people, to be sure, but it's not all a bed of roses.<br />
<br />
But the real problem here is that to an awful lot of people in the middle east America is this:<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm not suggesting that the idea Modine expresses isn't real. &nbsp It is. &nbsp It's real to me. But you can't ignore the reality that for all of our highminded "ideas" about what we are, we are most definitely &nbsp are also a globally dominant military empire, something which is bound to provoke hostility among at least some people on this planet. &nbsp And that would happen even if we were a completely benevolent and perfect empire, which we clearly are not. (Can empires even be perfect?)<br />
<br />
I'm all for the "idea" of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus">The New Colossus</a> being the one that Emma Lazarus intended:<br />

			<p><b>Piece of crap</b></p><p>
by Tom Sullivan</p><p>

In a lead Sunday op-ed, I once slammed local planners for wanting to develop a former factory site into yet another strip mall anchored by big-box stores. Low prices, low wages. Just what unemployed factory workers need, right? I couldn’t believe the editors allowed it to run with the line about stores selling “cheap, plastic crap from China.”</p><p>

Now this from the WaPo: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/09/12/the-postal-service-is-losing-millions-a-year-to-help-you-buy-cheap-stuff-from-china/">The Postal Service is losing millions a year to help you buy cheap stuff from China</a></p><p>

Via an arcane treaty mechanism, the U.S. Postal Service delivers small packages from Chinese merchants to destinations in the U.S. at below its cost. The inspector general’s office estimated that foreign “ePacket” treaty mail cost the USPS $79 million in 2013 and another $5 billion last year.</p>

<blockquote>But this has still been a money sink for the Postal Service. In 2012, USPS was paid only 94 cents on average for each piece of Chinese ePacket mail, according to a February report from the Postal Service’s inspector general’s office. That report estimated that the Postal Service was losing about a dollar on each incoming item, adding up to a $29.4 million net loss in 2012.</p><p>

Forums on eBay are filled with angry notes about ePacket. “I must say that it is simply an economic disaster for US Sellers,” one person wrote. “One product that we sell for 2.00 with 2.50 shipping a chinese company is selling for .99 with free shipping,” another complained. The person added, “Too much work no money here anymore. Let the Chinese have it.”</blockquote>The irony? writes Jeff Guo, "In a way, those who mail stuff abroad are helping to pay for other Americans to get cheap shipping on purchases from China." And this on top of the <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/background-on-the-159-billion-loss-by-the-postal-service">retirement fund requirement</a> imposed by Congress.</p><p>

As far as plotless yet pleasingly pastoral Scottish musicals centering on mentally unstable young female protagonists yearning to become pop stars go, I suppose you could do worse than <i><b>God Help the Girl</b></i>. Sort of an oddball cross between Alan Moyle's manic-depressive 1980 music biz drama <i>Times Square</i> and Gillian Armstrong's kooky, sunny-side-up 1982 new wave musical, <i>Starstruck</i>, the film (written, directed and scored by Belle &amp  Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch) stars Emily Browning as Eve, a clinically depressed young Glaswegian with musical inclinations...and the soul of a poet. Oh, and a cool beret.<br />
<br />
When we first meet her, Eve is in hospital for psychiatric counseling and treatment for an eating disorder. She has a habit of sneaking out to hit the live music clubs when no one is looking. During one of these excursions, Eve Meets Cute with a bespectacled, nebbish-y singer-guitarist named James (Olly Alexander), but not before witnessing the onstage dissolution of his band (an argument over volume levels results in show-stopping fisticuffs with his drummer during their opening number). James quickly intuits that Eve has a decent voice, a unique charisma and a natural gift for songwriting. He introduces Eve to his friend Cassie (Hannah Murray), an aspiring singer. Guess what happens next...<br />
<br />
There’s not much of a “story” to speak of, but Murdoch does sustain a kind of baroque mood throughout  an impressionistic rendering of a bittersweet, youthful summer idyll informed by Browning and Murray’s dreamy, airy, vocal performances and Murdoch’s lovely chamber pop-influenced melodies (and he’s not afraid to wear his influences on his sleeve...in one of the music sequences, he has Browning hold up a 45 RPM copy of “Pretty Ballerina” by the Left Banke). I found the baroque vibe pleasantly invocative of Paul McCartney’s <i>Give My Regards to Broad Street </i>(yes, I’m one of those contrarians who actually dug Sir Paul’s dreaded “vanity film”). While the jury is still out on whether this is a rock’n’roll fable aspiring to be a musical, or a musical aspiring to be a rock’n’roll fable, if you accept it as a collection of endearing music videos interstitially linked by a (very) loosely constructed narrative, you just might get away with calling it entertaining.<br />

			<b>And now a word from our isolationist libertarian Republican leadership</b><br />
<br />
by digby<br />
<br />
In case anyone was wondering if Rand Paul would be as consistent a libertarian on matters of national security and war as he is on denying health care to sick people and lowering taxes on the rich, I think <a href="http://m.weeklystandard.com/blogs/where-does-rand-stand_804897.html?nopager=1">you have your answer:</a><br />
<blockquote>Rand Paul's views on war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria continue to evolve. Speaking to reporters on the campaign trail Friday afternoon, the Kentucky senator didn't rule out supporting the deployment of U.S. combat troops on the ground in Iraq.<br />
<br />
"Senator Rubio this week said that combat troops on the ground--American combat troops--could be a possibility if the current strategy doesn't work," one reporter said after a campaign event featuring Paul and New Hampshire senatorial candidate Scott Brown. "Senator Paul, would you support such a move?"<br />
<br />
"I think some of it depends on what the events are. So events do change over time," Paul replied. "I'm a stickler for the Constitution, and the Constitution says Congress needs to determine these things." Back in June, Paul wrote in the Wall Street Journal that "we should not put any U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq, unless it is to secure or evacuate U.S. personnel and diplomatic facilities."</blockquote>Yes, there's the good old process dodge.  We need a vote! Ok Senator, but how would you vote? Uhm. We need a vote! (Also ,I need to be able to properly calculate the politics and how it would impact my presidential chances ...important stuff like that.)<br />
<blockquote>Paul also told reporters that it would be legal for the U.S. military to target U.S. citizens with lethal force in Iraq and Syria if they are engaged in battle--a position consistent with his past statements. But Paul declined to say if it would be legal to kill a U.S. citizen and ISIS member who is only plotting a terrorist attack in Iraq and Syria. <br />
<br />
"If you are engaged with battle against the United States, you really do not get due process on the battlefield. If you want to fight against the United States, you’re a target. Already, I think two Americans have been killed," Paul said.</blockquote><br />
Did I miss the constitutionally required vote to declare war Rand? Some stickler ...<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Paul has been very critical of the Obama administration's decision to kill U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative Anwar Awlaki in Yemen with a drone strike. The issue prompted him to wage a 13-hour filibuster with the sole purpose of getting the president to promise not to kill Americans with a drone strike "in a cafe in San Francisco" or anywhere else on American soil.<br />
<br />
Earlier this year, Paul objected to the nomination of a judge over the issue. Paul wrote in the New York Times that he couldn't support a nominee without "fully understanding that person’s views concerning the extrajudicial killing of American citizens." <br />
<br />
"Under our Constitution, [Awlaki] should have been tried — in absentia, if necessary — and allowed a legal defense," Paul wrote. "The Obama administration has established a legal justification that applies to every American citizen, whether in Yemen, Germany or Canada."<br />
I asked Paul twice if it would be legal to target a U.S. citizen in Iraq or Syria who was in a similar situation to Awlaki's, but the senator didn't directly answer the quest<br />
I asked Paul again if he could answer the question, reminding him of his 13-hour filibuster on the issue, but he was escorted out of the room by his press aides without answering the question. <br />
<br />
This was the second press conference that Paul had abruptly ended on Friday. Earlier that morning, following a New Hampshire GOP unity breakfast in Manchester, Paul acknowledged for the first time that his views about going to war with ISIS have changed. But the senator, apparently displeased with the questions, ended the media availability after just two minutes and six seconds.<br />
<br />
"Five years ago, if you asked me about ISIS, I would have said well you don’t need to do anything. So I mean obviously, the events do change your opinion. And your opinion of when a vital interest is being threatened is influenced by, you know, the beheading of two Americans," Paul said.</blockquote><br />
So there you have it. If anyone was counting on Paul to stand tall in the GOP and fight against their hawkish impulses, I think we can see how that's going to go.  No, he won't be John McCain.  But he won't be Ron Paul either.  He can't be.  Republicans are libertarian up to the point at which it requires Ameria to relinquish its status as a military empire. No modern Republican Senator, certainly not one from the South with its proud martial culture and heritage, can be an isolationist. <br />
<br />
But then I suspect that most libertarians (the majority of whom are younger white males) are fine with that.  Just don't make any laws and regulations that curtail their personal freedom or require them to pay money for something they don't immediately and directly benefit. That's where the real line is drawn.<br />
<br />
War?  Well, let's just say it's very convenient that the warmongers always say they're "protecting our freedom" regardless of whether our freedom is in any way at stake. <br />
<br />
<br />
The good news for Republicans is that Senate hopeful Scott Brown was unequivocal:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>"Let me jump in on that," Scott Brown interjected. "When people are in ISIS, then they’ve left their citizenship at the door."<br />
<br />
"I agree with Senator Cruz," said Brown, a former Massachusetts senator, who had just been endorsed that day by Rand Paul. "I’m glad [Senator Cruz] filed the bill that I filed twice already to strip them of that citizenship. They should not be able to hide behind the rights and privileges guaranteed by the Constitution, especially when they’re looking to hurt and kill our citizens."<br />
<br />
But what if these Americans are just planning attacks, not immediately fighting? "It doesn’t matter," Brown said. "They’ve left their citizenship at the door."</blockquote><br />
And we'll "know" who they are and what they're doing because ... how? Whatever. We just will.<br />
<br />
Interesting that someone running statewide in New Hampshire feels good about evoking the name of Ted Cruz. He's quite the role model.<br />

			<b>So they aren't more dangerous to us than al Qaeda after all? Why would they have said that?</b><br />
<br />
by digby<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, wait a minute. &nbsp The last I heard ISIS was so uniquely evil that they were even worse than al-Qaeda. In fact, they were so bad that al-Qaeda kicked them out of the gang because of their brutality.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/13/syria-obama-isis_n_5815388.html">So, what do we make of this?</a><br />
<blockquote>
While the Islamic State group is getting the most attention now, another band of extremists in Syria — a mix of hardened jihadis from Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and Europe — poses a more direct and imminent threat to the United States, working with Yemeni bomb-makers to target U.S. aviation, American officials say.<br />
<br />
At the center is a cell known as the Khorasan group, a cadre of veteran al-Qaida fighters from Afghanistan and Pakistan who traveled to Syria to link up with the al-Qaida affiliate there, the Nusra Front.<br />
<br />
But the Khorasan militants did not go to Syria principally to fight the government of President Bashar Assad, U.S. officials say. Instead, they were sent by al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to recruit Europeans and Americans whose passports allow them to board a U.S.-bound airliner with less scrutiny from security officials.<br />
<br />
In addition, according to classified U.S. intelligence assessments, the Khorasan militants have been working with bomb-makers from al-Qaida's Yemen affiliate to test new ways to slip explosives past airport security. The fear is that the Khorasan militants will provide these sophisticated explosives to their Western recruits who could sneak them onto U.S.-bound flights.<br />
<br />
The Obama administration has said that the Islamic State group, the target of more than 150 U.S. airstrikes in recent weeks, does not pose an imminent threat to the continental U.S. The Khorasan group, which has not been subject to American military action, is considered the more immediate threat.</blockquote>
<br />
So <i>al Qaeda</i> is actually the group that we must keep from killing us all in our beds, not ISIS?  Just like we've <i>been</i> keeping them from killing us in our beds for 13 years?<br />
<br />
Huh ...<br />
<br />
I'm being facetious and it's probably inappropriate. But <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/fyi-on-new-boogeyman.html">many of us have been pointing out for months</a> the reason Al Qaeda split with ISIS was because it was being <i>too brutal to fellow Muslims</i> when al Qaeda's mission was to take on the Great Satan --- just as it has been for a decade and a half. In other words, little had changed for Americans in the threat department. Al Qaeda still wants to kill us but we've been pretty successful at keeping them from doing that. For some reason we needed a new boogeyman. I wonder why?<br />
<br />
We've spent trillions on Homeland Security, outfitted every Barney Fife in the nation with robo-cop gear and allowed the government to spy on Americans at will. &nbsp I don't know about you but I kind of expect that all of that should actually be worth something. If we're going to run around tearing our hair out every time somebody puts out a scary video maybe it's time to re-evaluate that strategy. <br />
<br />
This is not to say that there isn't a threat for the people in the Middle East and there is a legitimate argument to be made that it requires intervention from outside the region lest the whole place blows up even further. (I'm not sure we won't make things worse --- we usually do -- but I understand the arguments for it.) What is galling is the fact that they continue to treat us like children and tell us spooky bedtime stories so they can scare us into supporting their commercial/geopolitical goals. Maybe those goals are worth pursuing but we'll never know because we're chasing evil Ninjas who are allegedly coming over the border to unleash mushroom clouds on American cities. <br />
<br />
I'm serious.  This is what Fox News reporter Todd Starnes said on Hannity last night:<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
RT&nbsp <a href="https://twitter.com/toddstarnes">@toddstarnes</a> "what will O call it when there's a mushroom cloud over an American city because terrorists came over the border to attack"<br />
— Liberty Lives Here (@PJimmy18) <a href="https://twitter.com/PJimmy18/status/510620589028282369">September 13, 2014</a></blockquote>
<br />
And frankly, I'm almost as disgusted that the American people continue to be thrilled at the prospect of kicking ass over some trumped up threat --- and yes, I do believe that a whole lot of us are anxious to get back to the business of ass-kicking.  It's much more exciting than thinking about the wealthy elites stealing more and more of your meager earnings. But it's a dangerous and nasty way to entertain ourselves out of a nasty malaise. <br />
<br />
Al Qaeda has a strategy to create dramatic terrorist attacks on the West. &nbsp We've known this for a long, long time. That has not changed. &nbsp ISIS is a different problem. The fact that the war hawks pimped this line about ISIS being worse than Al Qaeda should make everyone skeptical of what they are hearing about this whole thing --- and skeptical of the motivations behind it. &nbsp How many times do we have to be lied to?<br />

As so many Villagers love to do, Chuck Todd&nbsp <a href="http://www.hughhewitt.com/chuck-todd-romney-3-0/">appeared with right winger Hugh Hewitt</a> the other day. They chit-chatted about this and that, but I thought this conclusion was particularly fascinating</div>
<br />
<blockquote>
HH: &nbsp ... I want to ask you the Politico question. In today’s Politico, Robert C. O’Brien and I write an article called Romney 3.0, Third Time’s A Charm. What do you think? Is it possible he’s going to get in?&nbsp </blockquote>
<blockquote>
CT: I think he only gets in if he’s drafted. I feel like that that’s the hint he’s been saying, and I’ve talked to some folks who know him very well. He is not going to go through a grueling primary campaign. He is not going to sit here and defend his conservative credentials again, go through schlepping around, allowing all these guys to take pot shots on him. I think he is open to this if it’s a draft movement, and if it’s sort of like everybody else doesn’t fit.&nbsp </blockquote>
<blockquote>
Now here’s why I think Mitt Romney, it’s funny you bring this up, because I think the reason why Romney 3.0 has gotten traction is less about Romney, and more about the current issues of the day. I think the Republican 2016 field as we thought we knew it, think Scott Walker, think Chris Christie, think Marco Rubio, think Bobby Jindal, you know, throw those names in. I think if you have issues like national security front and center, that’s an incredibly shrinking, I feel like all of those guys are suddenly shrinking in stature. None of them, if the chief criticism of Barack Obama by a lot of people is you know what, he just wasn’t experienced enough, he just didn’t have a grasp of everything you needed to know to be able to be commander-in-chief, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>
HH: Yeah.&nbsp </blockquote>
<blockquote>
CT: That’s among, particularly among the conservative criticisms. Well then, how does Scott Walker fit into that? How does Chris Christie? How does Bobby Jindal? How does Marco Rubio? You know, they don’t, and so suddenly, Mitt Romney, while not having a lot of experience on foreign policy, certainly running for president and certainly now he can go back and say hey, I made these points against the President, and I look a little more prescient today than maybe some people thought three years ago.&nbsp </blockquote>
<blockquote>
So I think that’s why he seems to look larger right now in stature because of the issues of the day that are front and center, and if you look at the rest of this Republican field. They don’t seem as if they have the resume to reassure hawks in the party.&nbsp </blockquote>
<blockquote>
HH: Prescient as always. Chuck Todd, we’ll be watching Sunday for Jim Baker. Thanks for joining us.</blockquote>
Todd's absolutely correct. All of these ex-Governors with no foreign policy experience don't look all that exciting when the focus is on foreign policy. That's why Mitt Romney, the ex-Governor with no foreign policy experience, is such an intriguing prospect. He's run for president twice and lost which is almost the same thing as being Commander in Chief. &nbsp Plus he can say I told you so, which is always a reassuring appeal.<br />
<br />
Really, is there any other choice?<br />
<br />
Prescient as always.<br />

			<p><b>Are we holding the leash or wearing the collar?</b></p><p>
by Tom Sullivan</p><p>

Naomi Klein <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/13/greenwashing-sticky-business-naomi-klein">contemplates</a> the struggle between climate change and the globalization juggernaut. It is a struggle she once left to environmentalists. But having struggled with infertility and having covered the Gulf oil spill, her perspective changed. "It's not that I got in touch with my inner Earth Mother," Klein writes, "it's that I started to notice that if the Earth is indeed our mother, then she is a mother facing a great many fertility challenges of her own."</p><p>

That climate change is linked to our lifestyle and our economy – and our attempts to deal with planetary warming without changing either – is the crux of Klein's long piece in the Guardian:</p>
<blockquote>"What is wrong with us? I think the answer is far more simple than many have led us to believe: we have not done the things needed to cut emissions because those things fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism, the reigning ideology for the entire period we have struggled to find a way out of this crisis. We are stuck, because the actions that would give us the best chance of averting catastrophe – and benefit the vast majority – are threatening to an elite minority with a stranglehold over our economy, political process and media."</blockquote>Read: Billionaires with good intentions, flashy pronouncements, and market-driven solutions have failed to curb emissions. Much of the piece focuses on Richard Branson's failed, but much ballyhooed efforts to apply a the same business savvy that made him rich to save the planet.</p><p>

<blockquote>The idea that only capitalism can save the world from a crisis it created is no longer an abstract theory  it's a hypothesis that has been tested in the real world. We can now take a hard look at the results: at the green products shunted to the back of the supermarket shelves at the first signs of recession  at the venture capitalists who were meant to bankroll a parade of innovation but have come up far short  at the fraud-infested, boom-and-bust carbon market that has failed to cut emissions. And, most of all, at the billionaires who were going to invent a new form of enlightened capitalism but decided, on second thoughts, that the old one was just too profitable to surrender.</blockquote>

Post-Reagan, deregulated capitalism has long looked like something out of <a href="http://scrutinyhooligans.us/2010/09/05/shortage-of-work-day/">Mary Shelley or science-fiction films</a>, a creature we created, but no longer control. Billionaires and their acolytes see only its benefits, but as Jeff Goldblum's Dr. Ian Malcolm says in <i>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</i>, "<a href="http://www.hark.com/clips/vxsnntctsg-how-it-starts">Oh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running, and then screaming.</a>" Where once We the People held capitalism's leash, now we wear the collar.</p><p> 

Whether it's turning your child's education from a shared public cost into a corporate profit center  or turning the principle of one-man, one-vote into one-dollar, one-vote  or carbon tax credits and accounting tricks for addressing rising sea levels  questioning the universal application of a business approach to any human need or problem prompts the challenge, "Do you have something against making a profit?" A more subtle form of red-baiting, this ploy is supposed to be a conversation stopper. Yes? You're a commie. Game over.</p><p>  

Maybe it's time our billionaire problem-solvers got over themselves.</p> <br>

<br />
<br />
They won't be able to do it again, right? We are smarter now. Many of us even spotted it all at the time. But it didn't stop the war train. How do we use our knowledge this time?<br />
<br />
Can they use our emotion like last time? After 13 years the confusion, sadness, anger and desire to act has diminished. &nbsp And now we have been&nbsp lied to. And bilked. And emotionally manipulated by professionals.<br />
<br />
If someone wants to evoke that 9/12 feeling again they need a fresh jolt to the system. Like beheadings.<br />
<br />
Following 9/12/2001 the rage and anger was scaled up to include entire regions. The right wing wanted an entire religious faith to be punished. Any suggestion of trying to understand who did it and why it happened was mocked. Anything less than "glass parking lots" was "letting the terrorists win."<br />
<br />
But in 2014 you can start asking questions. Might there be another way to deal with this current atrocity? Can there be a direct police-type action for the crime?<br />
<br />
We've learned from the 2003 run up to the Iraq War. Yes, a lot of us knew what was up at the time, but our protests were ignored. What will we do differently this time? New chants? Or can we use the tools and leverage we have now we didn't have before?<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Fall War Launch Needs New Words, Images, People and Emotion</b><br />
<br />
We know how they sold the Iraq War to us. Spot the tricks this time! Look for:<br />
<br />
<b>Words.</b> Notice the words and phrases being used this time. "<b>Boots on the ground.</b>" It's all about protecting our people. Drones aren't "boots in the air" so they are fine. This shift in focus from people to machines&nbsp <b>should </b>lead us to<b> look at the cost,</b> but will it?<br />
<br />
Keep an eye on&nbsp the word&nbsp <b>degrade</b>, that's an emotional word pawned off as a military and physical action. Degrade has that, "It happens over a long period of time" feeling to it. That's intentional.<br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>Images.</b>&nbsp The beheading videos are powerful, but they won't be showing them over and over. That means the military will offer up successful bombing videos--from a distance. Look for what they don't want us to see.<br />
Closer in photos of the innocent dead.<br />
<br />
Of course if these photos slip out they will be condemned as inciting violence toward us. The people who provide them (or retweet and publish them) will be labeled traitors for &nbsp helping the terrorists. Fox News will remind people of all the bad people we killed without loss of US lives. They will probably do a fair and balanced chart of it.<br />
<br />
<b>People.</b>&nbsp Keep an eye out for the retired Generals. Who pays them? Do they work for people selling drones? &nbsp <b>Could someone please check them now?</b> Call the TV producers and demand they mention their affiliations. Also, who is paying the think tank people? Foreign governments? Defense contractors?<br />
<br />
The media already has brought on tired old "experts" to make the case for war, but <b>who is new in the media opposing war?</b>&nbsp If our "boots on the ground" aren't in danger, can we get some accountants on to talk about the cost of these drone strikes? &nbsp How about representatives of the innocent dead? Someone from a Big 8 Peace firm? &nbsp Who do you suggest?<br />
<br />
<b>Emotion</b>. If they can't get anger, they will go for fear. Any attack in the US or on US interests will be linked to ISIL faster than you can say, Al Qaeda in Iraq.<br />
<br />
I've heard three experts say it would be very hard for ISIL to attack the US. They will find someone who says they can. He will be in heavy rotation on Fox.<br />
<br />
How do you stop them from using emotion? You can't, but you can offer other emotions. Like courage.<br />
<br />
<b>Denying Them Their War Propoganda</b><br />
<br />
David Swanson wrote an interesting piece, &nbsp <a href="http://my.firedoglake.com/davidswanson/2014/09/12/james-foley-is-not-a-war-ad/">James Foley Is Not a War Ad</a><br />
<br />
He makes the point, with video to back it up, that Foley would not have wanted the video of his death to be used this way.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
What if people in the United States were to watch the video of Foley when he was alive and speaking and laughing, not the one when he was a prop in a piece of propaganda almost certainly aimed at provoking the violence that Obama has just obligingly announced?</blockquote>
I can't speak for the dead, Foley was human and I understand the reaction of most, "Let's get the bastards who did this." &nbsp But who he was leads me to believe he wouldn't want his death to be scaled up to a war.<br />
<br />
We can't control the actions of the group called ISIL, but we can control our response to them. Let's not let the bastards who lied and manipulated us into the last war get away with it again.<br />

A nice reminder that this person might have been involved in making policy:<br />
<blockquote>"They are so full of deception that America should be concerned with the policies that are going on. And, as I watched the speech last night, Sean, the thought going through my mind is ‘I owe America a global apology. Because John McCain, through all of this, John McCain should be our president.’ He had the advice, today, still giving it to Barack Obama, and he will not listen to it, about the residual forces that must be left behind in order to secure the peace in Iraq that we had fought so hard for.”<br />
<br />
“That triangle, of course, the foundation in the region of their power, for it to be taken over by the bad guys, that could have been avoided had Barack Obama listened to the best military advice, and that was ‘Barack, you have to leave that residual force in order to continue what it is we are doing.’ We don’t have to have combat troops over there at that time, but that residual force in order to secure….but, no, and now here we are saying, uh, well, it’s going to take boots on the ground to win this thing, and yet, we’re not going to send boots on the ground? We’re going to contract this thing out when there is no mightier power than the red, white, and blue?”<br />

<br />
<blockquote>
“Folks, … this is crazy,” Rush Limbaugh said on the Friday edition of his successful radio talk show. “We’re feminizing this game, and it’s a man’s game, and if we keep feminizing this game, we’re going to ruin it  if we keep ‘chickifying’ this game, we’re going to ruin it. It’s going to become something that it was never intended to be.”<br />
<br />
Limbaugh’s worry came in response to the growing demands for introspection being directed toward the NFL in the wake of the public release of video showing Ray Rice assaulting his partner. “So many men — executive in the league, and sports [media] — are in a race to see who can be the most politically correct, feminized guy,” Limbaugh said. “It’s comical.”</blockquote>
Seriously, what kind of a real man doesn't knock out his girlfriend in an elevator once in a while, amirite? And the fact that he didn't even seem to be slightly concerned about the fact that she was <i>unconscious</i> just further proves his manliness. He dragged her out of the elevator didn't he? What more do these feminazis want? <br />
<br />
I honestly don't know what it will take for decent people to reject Rush LImbaugh, but you would think that any decent person would find these comments beyond the pale.  It's fair to assume that anyone who doesn't isn't a decent person.<br />

I'm getting some blowback for suggesting that this argument about congressional authorization is a dodge, but I honestly believe that &nbsp it's inevitable that the congress will approve it if they decide to take it up. &nbsp Therefore, it doesn't matter if they take it up.<br />
<br />
This is happening. It has been happening with regularity since 1991 under presidents of both parties regardless of congressional approval.<br />

We have been fighting in Iraq in one way or another for 23 years.<br />

			<b>Is it time to revisit our prohibition on paying ransom?</b><br />

<br />
Uhm, if true, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/government-threatened-foley-family-ransom-payments-mother-slain/story?id=2545 63">this is just horrible:</a><br />
<br />
<blockquote>
Obama administration officials repeatedly threatened the family of murdered journalist James Foley that they might face criminal charges for supporting terrorism if they paid ransom to the ISIS killers who ultimately beheaded their son, his mother and brother said this week.<br />
<br />
"We were told that several times and we took it as a threat and it was appalling," Foley's mother Diane told ABC News in an interview.<br />
<br />
She said the warnings over the summer came primarily from a highly decorated military officer serving on the White House's National Security Council staff, which five outraged current and former officials with direct knowledge of the Foley case also recounted to ABC News in recent weeks.<br />
<br />
"Three times he intimidated us with that message. We were horrified he would say that. He just told us we would be prosecuted. We knew we had to save our son, we had to try," Diane Foley said.</blockquote>
<br />
Nice, really nice ...<br />
<br />
<a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/americans-dont-seem-to-be-as-eager-for.html">As I've written before</a>, this issue of ransom is one that has to be discussed more fully especially not that warhawks <i>and</i> terrorists are using the recorded execution of hostages for propaganda and recruitment purposes. I don't think our adamant refusal to ever "negotiate with terrorists" is getting the results we want. Not claiming to have the answer here, but something's gone wrong. <br />
<br />
And threatening the family of someone who ended up being publicly beheaded with criminal charges of aiding terrorism is just disgusting. And I don't know that this is even official US policy. According to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/21/the-logic-of-not-paying-ransoms/">this article </a>it isn't:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
The U.S. government certainly tried to save James Foley before he was executed by Islamic State extremists. Sources have told The Washington Post that a secret raid was conducted in a bid to save the American journalist and others. It failed because the hostages were not at that location at that moment.<br />
<br />
However, there may have been one big tactic they didn't try: paying a ransom. David Rohde, a well-respected journalist who works at the Atlantic and the Reuters news agency, touched upon this Wednesday, when he wondered whether U.S. foreign policy had failed Foley with its refusal to negotiate with his captors. Rohde points out that journalists of other nationalities were apparently released after their governments paid large sums to the Islamic State, something the U.S. government refuses to do (though private individuals and entities may).</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/20/rohde-foley-idUSL2N0QQ2 20140820">Rohde has spoken out about this before</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the days and weeks ahead, the Foley family will speak for themselves about their ordeal. But the payment of ransoms and abduction of foreigners must emerge from the shadows. It must be publicly debated. American and European policymakers should be forced to answer for their actions.<br />
<br />
Foley believed that his government would help him, according to his family. In a message that was not made public, Foley said that he believed so strongly that Washington would help that he refused to allow his fellow American captives to not believe in their government.<br />
<br />
A consistent response to kidnapping by the U.S. and Europe is desperately needed. The current haphazard approach is failing.</blockquote>
If what the Foley family is saying is true, we have a major problem on our hands. Threatening the family of an abducted journalist with criminal charges for terrorism is indeed appalling. But the fact that everyone, including the president, is using the execution of these prisoners as a rationale for military action &nbsp means that this policy has major ramifications we have not fully examined.<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-remarks-on-strategy-to-confront-isis">QOTD: Senator Chris Murphy</a><br />
<blockquote>
Americans today, more than ever, feel like they have lost control of their lives, of their ability to feel financially, economically, and even physically secure. These videos, and reports of ISIS’s unconscionable brutality, add to this feeling of insecurity. And they invoke rage –justifiable, appropriate rage – about those who would carry out such acts.<br />
<br />
In this case, the fear and the anger that we feel about ISIS’s actions is complemented by a legitimate threat that this group poses. So we shouldn’t hesitate to act, simply because our desire to do so is fueled by the intense emotion that this enemy engenders in us. But our response – the details of our strategy – cannot be dictated by these impulses. Our plan of attack against ISIS needs to be well thought-out, nuanced, not rushed into because we feel an emotional compulsion to do something – anything – right now.<br />
<br />
We’ve made that mistake in the past as a nation, and we shouldn’t misstep again. And we certainly shouldn’t allow election year politics to play into our calculations. This is a debate about ISIS, but it’s also a debate about how we’re going to meet a potential plethora of anti-Western extremist groups that are, and will, organize against us throughout the world. We’re creating a precedent for action, and we shouldn’t rush into action simply because we feel pressure to get something done before an election. As the President noted last night, and it’s important to repeat, ISIS today does not have imminent plans to attack the United States. That doesn’t diminish the necessity of taking them on, it simply means that we don’t need to engage in a panicked response.</blockquote>
I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who recognizes that Americans are frustrated by the chaotic nature of the world today and their own feelings of powerlessness and so are ready to engage in some "action" --- any action &nbsp --- to assert control. And it's good that someone is recognizing how the financial and economic insecurities of our time might lead us into making some major errors in judgment. Since we are a military empire, those errors in judgment about what action to take are unfortunately likely to fall into that category.<br />
<br />
If you read the rest of his comments you'll see that the ship has sailed, however.  He's backing the president's strategy for the most part while cautioning him about mission creep and demanding a debate in congress, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/11/rachel_maddow_rand_paul_mitch_mcconnell_agree_but_the_isis_debate_they_want_simply_wont_matter/">which I argue here in Salon</a>, is one of those procedural dodges in any case.  Yes, the congress should debate. But let's not bullshit ourselves into believing it will make some sort of difference.  It never has before. If the congress votes, whether for explicit authorization or simply for the funding, they will find a majority to support. Murphy says the president will get his authorization if he wants it. &nbsp Everyone says he'll get his authorization. Every member of congress is deciding right now whether it's best to be on record supporting or opposing, calculating the odds down the road. Maybe they'll let the president take all the risk and the potential glory. &nbsp If I had to bet, I'd say they'll vote.  And if they vote, they will vote yes. And if they don't vote, it's happening anyway. &nbsp So why are we obsessing about this?<br />
<br />
This whole argument reminds me of the one before the Iraq war in which all of us liberals --- myself included --- argued vociferously for UN authorization as if that was the be-all and end all of the issue at hand. &nbsp But the real issue was the decision to invade Iraq and it would have been wrong whether we did it under the auspices of the UN or not. &nbsp UN approval wouldn't have changed it and arguing as if that was what really mattered made it seem as though the process was more important than the result. &nbsp And when it comes to war, I don't think that's true at all, particularly since once you've reached the stage of asking for permission the default is almost always to defer to war anyway.<br />
<br />
Certainly the congress in the US is most likely to rubber stamp whatever the president wants to do in these matters. There is very little precedent for anything else and if you look at the political make-up of both houses you are not going to see an anti-war majority in either one. &nbsp So all of our braying about congressional authorization has no potential to change the decision to escalate in Iraq and Syria. (Now, down the road, if it all goes wrong, they can try to use the power of the purse to pull the president back, but for right now, the di is cast. ) We're going, and the only question is whether congress wants to be part of the show. They will not stop it at this point.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Murphy is right that this should not be done out of a sense of frustration that the world is chaotic place and Americans can't seem to get a grip. But that's part of what's motivating this willingness to be baited into action by these dramatic videos.  I've always been skeptical of the "no-drama Obama" business but I've been glad he seemed to be taking a deliberate approach and not stoking this sense of alarm in this situation.  His speech, unfortunately, broke with that and he sounded a lot more like George W. Bush than I've ever heard him sound before. That's too bad. I get it. He was baited too, and not just by ISIS but by American warmongers. Still, I had hoped for less flag-waving and more "keep calm and carry on." <br />

			<p><b>An economic cult</b></p><p>

by Tom Sullivan</p><p>

Paul Krugman this morning <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/opinion/paul-krugman-the-inflation-cult.html?_r=0">writes</a> about "the inflation cult," doomsaying pundits and supposed economic experts who, economic rain or shine, predict that a steep rise in inflation is coming anytime now and, quite reliably, get it wrong time after time.</p>
<blockquote>Part of that appeal is clearly political  there’s a reason why Mr. Santelli yells about both inflation and how President Obama <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2009/02/cnbcs-santelli/">is giving money away to “losers,”</a> why Mr. Ryan warns about both a debased currency and a government that <a href="http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/13/paul-ryan/has-ryan-remained-consistent-talking-about-what-h-/">redistributes from “makers” to “takers.”</a> Inflation cultists almost always link the Fed’s policies to complaints about government spending. They’re completely wrong about the details — no, the Fed isn’t printing money to cover the budget deficit — but it’s true that governments whose debt is denominated in a currency they can issue have more fiscal flexibility, and hence more ability to maintain aid to those in need, than governments that don’t.</p><p>

And anger against “takers” — anger that is very much tied up with ethnic and cultural divisions — runs deep. Many people, therefore, feel an affinity with those who rant about looming inflation  Mr. Santelli is their kind of guy. In an important sense, I’d argue, the persistence of the inflation cult is an example of the “affinity fraud” crucial to many swindles, in which investors trust a con man because he seems to be part of their tribe. In this case, the con men may be conning themselves as well as their followers, but that hardly matters.</p><p>

This tribal interpretation of the inflation cult helps explain the sheer rage you encounter when pointing out that the promised hyperinflation is nowhere to be seen. It’s comparable to the reaction you get when pointing out that Obamacare seems to be working, and probably has the same roots.</p>
</blockquote>Not just economists, but the country (and perhaps the entire Republican Party) seems to be in the grip of an economic cult concerned with much more than inflation -- that's just a symptom. As Krugman suggests, ethnic and cultural (and class) divisions factor into it. Digby has written repeatedly (and just yesterday) that many of the same people "<a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-gates-of-hell-brought-to-you-by.html">have always been wrong about everything</a>." And yet, their followers keep listening. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rick-perlstein/i-didnt-like-nixon-_b_11735.html">Conservatism never fails</a>. It is <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pseudoscience#Ideas_are_unfalsifiable">unfalsifiable</a>. I wrote <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/like-beer-youll-love-koch-by-bloggersrus.html">last week</a> that the Koch brothers' evangelism for the their libertarian Kochification Church resembles recruiting techniques used by cults.</p><p>

			<b>America's blood is up</b><br />

<br />
Matt Yglesias delivers <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/11/6135197/obamas-risky-isis-rhetoric">an interesting critique </a>of President Obama's strategy and rhetoric. &nbsp I tend to agree that the regional coalition is a no-brainer and that the bombing campaign in Iraq was just inevitable.  (It's been our catch-all strategy for decades now ...) The long term prospects for "eradicating" ISIS through such a strategy are not good, but they could be slowed at least in some respects. The potential of unintended consequences is growing by the minute.<br />
<br />
However, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/11/6135197/obamas-risky-isis-rhetoric">Yglesias points out</a> that the real danger here is exacerbating the threat with all this sabre rattling. (Apparently, everything at Vox has to be in list form ...?)<br />
<blockquote>7) The biggest problem with Obama's current approach isn't what he's promising to do, but what he's promising to accomplish. Over the course of 2014, Obama's anti-ISIS statements have become increasingly dire and alarmist.<br />
<br />
8) The shift in tone appears to have two causes. One is backlash to his ill-advised quip about ISIS being global jihad's JV team. The other is polling indicating that the American public was profoundly affected by the execution videos, which were the single most widely-noted news event since 2009.<br />
<br />
9) Public opinion always matters in politics and therefore in policymaking, but the fact of the matter is that the American people have this a bit mixed up. The beheadings are not the most alarming thing ISIS did this summer (try taking Mosul or genocidal violence against religious minority groups) and the rise of ISIS isn't even the summer's most alarming foreign policy crisis (try Russia's invasion of Ukraine and apparent probing of Estonian and Finnish borders). There is no good reason for the United States to take maximal action against ISIS, not least because none of our potential partners in the region are going to.<br />
<br />
10) Alarmist rhetoric and a policy of wise restraint make odd bedfellows. If the US catches some lucky breaks (or ISIS some bad ones) it may all work out for the best. But Obama's speeches are writing checks his policy can't necessarily cash. And eliminating ISIS' ability to occasional kidnap westerners who travel into the conflict zone is much more difficult than eliminating its ability to capture new Iraqi cities or threaten major oil fields. If another shoe drops in a bad way, there is enormous risk that the president has set the country up for a cycle of unwise escalation.<br />
<br />
11) "We will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq," Obama promised last night. Certainly we shouldn't. But in the context of the administration's stated aspirations, this is more of a vague hope than anything else. If Obama really wants to stick to the policy he's outlined, he needs to find a more measured way to describe what he's promising it will achieve.</blockquote>It seems to me that he's overreacting to criticism and that's a bad thing in these situations. People will calm down about the beheading videos if our leadership stays calm and reassuring. The only reason not to is to gin up support for war --- and if Obama has finally come around to that way of thinking it's very disappointing. He doesn't need the nation to be hysterical over this simply because Huckleberry Graham is waving his hands and calling for the fainting couch.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/09/obama-iraq-isis-speech">David Corn asked the right question</a> about all this (and not just the rhetoric, but the strategy itself) in this piece:<br />
<blockquote>After depicting ISIS as a peril warranting a US military response—and with much of the American public convinced of that—can he then shrug his shoulders and say never mind? Will he provide the hawks an opening for political attacks and demands for greater military intervention? In his speech, the man who ran for president with the pledge to end the Iraq war declared, “we will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq.” But what if all else fails? He vowed to eradicate the ISIS “cancer,” noting it will take time to do so. Can he stop if his non-war counter-terrorism campaign does not defeat the disease? It is hard to put the case for war back in the box.</blockquote>He's right.  Once you start with the chest beating about a mortal enemy such as the world has rarely known, you trap yourself into acting, something the president had thus far adroitly avoided. As Ed Kilgore <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2014_09/it_is_hard_to_put_the_case_for052050.php">wisely pointed out</a>:<br />
<blockquote>It doesn’t help that Obama closed his speech, as I noted last night, with an appeal to American Exceptionalism: if we don’t “destroy” IS, we’re not simply exposing U.S. interests to danger, but skewing the moral compass of the whole world. That distorted self-image of the United States as the first, last and only resort for the vindication of wrongs is also difficult to “put back in the box” after it’s projected so often, even as a rhetorical afterthought. </blockquote><br />
I think this is about America itself feeling a lack of control over all these recent chaotic events, including the collapse of the economy, and demanding that the government take some sort of action. Which is ironic since the cognoscenti are determined to portray the country as a bunch of isolationist, small government libertarian/conservatives who just want to be left alone to pray. In reality, everyone knows we're a big, rich, badass military empire and a majority of Americans don't like the fact that other people in the world think they have some agency to act while we sit around watching our standard of living go down and our future prospects dim. &nbsp (The fact that much of our problem stems from our being a big-badass military empire hasn't really penetrated.) So the president has simply come around to giving them what they want.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Update:<b></b></b> Yeah, baby.  <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/house-republicans-torn-on-obama-syria-request-20140911">Now we're talking:</a><br />
<br />
<blockquote>Rep. John Fleming said many see the president's strategy as not nearly enough.<br />
<br />
"This is a stalemate strategy," he said. "I think that we would want to see an all-out war, shock and awe. We put troops on the ground, we put all of our assets there after properly prepping the battlefield, and in a matter of a few weeks we take these guys out … and we leave a stay-behind force to keep our friends up and going, and also maybe a no-fly zone in Syria over the area Assad controls."<br />
<br />
Others are worried that the situation will escalate and noted their constituents are, too. Rep. John Carter, whose Texas district includes Fort Hood and who chairs the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, said he told members in the meeting that if Congress is going to commit to this strategy, it must fund the military at a higher level.<br />
<br />
"If we're going to do this, nobody's that got any sense can think any way other than we will eventually have boots on the ground. We already have 1,500. Those people are not wearing ballet slippers over there," said Carter. "And so the reality is, if we're asking these tired, overcommitted quite patriotic families to do this some more, we've got to start reinforcing them. We've got to start building our military back, not cutting it."</blockquote><br />

<blockquote>
War is hell. So go big or go home, Mr. President. Big means bold, confident, wise assurance from a trustworthy Commander-in-Chief that it shall all be worth it. Charge in, strike hard, get out. Win.<br />
<br />
Obama famously claims to despise the “theater” and “optics” of the presidency. In tonight's speech he illustrated the “optics” of toughness. He tried to show a war-weary America that he’s tough in his speech concerning the threat of ISIS/ISIL. “The One” who believes in leading from behind can’t have it both ways. He sure wasn’t concerned about “optics” when he let the crisis starring this Islamic death cult reach this point as he dithered and danced and golfed the time away while the Middle East exploded into chaos.<br />
<br />
Tonight he announced he’s flipped and will finally militarily engage inside Syria – the red line he’d set and then forgotten about surfaced again. This, after three and a half years of civil war, 200,000 people killed, and millions displaced amid horrifying humanitarian conditions. Last month, he authorized U.S. military action to stall ISIS’ momentum as it’s taken nearly complete control of Iraq. Tonight, President Obama pledged to fight Islamic militants “wherever they exist” with a very small coalition of the willing. (Can you blame foreign nations for not trusting the resolve of this president enough to join us? Right now he has a coalition of nine  President Bush had over 40 allied countries that could trust America’s leadership.)<br />
<br />
Remember the inexperienced presidential candidate speaking from Germany at the Brandenburg Gate (2008)? Or the know-it-all state senator (2002), known for merely voting “present” on the big things, yet lecturing about this “dumb war” he claimed was a distraction from his desire to force income redistribution to create security. Remember him? Today, he seems more worried about contradicting his campaign promises (2002-2008) and typical political poll angst than leading as president (2009-present). These are the “optics” he's worried about.<br />
<br />
The rise of the animalistic terror group, ISIS, is the result of Obama’s lead-from-behind foreign policy. He had broadcast his war strategy for all the enemy to see in Iraq, so the enemy could wait us out and strike as soon as America turned tail and turned away from all we’d sacrificed there. Terrorists who we had under control got to regroup and grow after Obama’s premature pull out. Those are the facts, and some tough talking speech is still just talk. Ronald Reagan was described by the Soviets as a politician for whom “words and deeds are one and the same.” When Reagan said his vision of the Cold War was “we win, they lose,” he meant it, and his policies won the Cold War. The real question Americans and our allies must ask is whether Obama-the-lecturer's words will translate into deeds.<br />
<br />
Go big and be real, Mr. President, if you've really changed your mind again and now wish to engage. You must acknowledge reality: the organization calling itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is, in fact, “Islamic.” Not many of us pretend to be experts on the Muslim religion, but these terrorists obviously consider themselves Muslim and they believe what they’re horrifically doing to innocents is part of their “religion of peace.” So, you can use your soapbox to fiercely encourage the sane, civilized Muslims of the world to tell ISIS and all these sickening terrorists that they’re wrong. In the meantime, we must identify and understand the enemy by at least acknowledging their ideological motivation and identity. Our president is naive to ignore this.<br />
<br />
ISIS must be stopped in Iraq and Syria before we need to stop them anywhere else. As they dominate the region they head for us  we're next on the hit list. For the sake of peace-loving people in America and throughout the world, let’s hope Barack Obama means what he says when he uses terms like “defeating ISIS.” He is so inconsistent in leading a failed agenda that it’s virtually impossible to put any hope in his new promises, because either his past statements shrugging off ISIS as just a “JV squad” was all talk or tonight’s new terminology is just all talk.<br />
<br />
We should honor and understand our brave men and women of the U.S. armed forces today more than ever. Please do not support politicians who join Obama in diminishing our military. Our finest, trained to fight for what is right and determined to win, deserve our support. Thank you, military, may you be heard when you pray America’s leadership understands that if we’re in it, then we're in it to win it  no half measures. Troops, we are always with you.<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh, were you under the impression that the right wing wasn't pro-war anymore?  That they had turned into some amalgam of John Galt and Robert Taft? <br />
<br />
No, they're the same old bloodthirsty warmongers they always were. Counting on anyone besides Justin Amash and maybe a handful of wingnuts who just want to stick it to Obama to oppose any escalation in killing is a fools errand. This is what it's all about for them. <br />
<br />
And, by the way, from what I'm seeing there are more than a few liberals who might disagree with her criticism of Obama but wouldn't really argue too much with her exhortation to "Win" whatever the hell that means.  Evidently, they too are concerned that ISIS is coming to kill them any day now. <br />

			<b>Why the lack of accountability among the powerful is perverting our society</b><br />
<br />

<br />
Why is it that prosecutors are so loathe to admit that they might have made a mistake? &nbsp Apparently, it's a psychological tick that we all have. But it seems to me that prosecutors have a particular responsibility to be open to error --- and if they aren't we should have better mechanisms for ensuring that they are. The legal system doesn't seem to be very good at it.<br />
<br />
But then, this is a wider political and sociological problem as well, isn't it? &nbsp Just look at how our political system protects the likes of Dick Cheney and other torture advocates? They aren't even shunned &nbsp --- they're welcomed back into respectable company as if it never happened.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there's a problem, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/10/%E2%80%9Cthey_refuse_to_admit_they_were_wrong%E2%80%9D_how_nightmare_prosecutors_pervert_american_justice/">which I discussed in more detail in this piece for Salon</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
Yesterday, historian Rick Perlstein wrote <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/08/watergates_most_lasting_sin_gerald_ford_richard_nixon_and_the_pardon_that_made_us_all_cynics/">an important piece about the Nixon pardon</a>, which he shows was the true beginning of the political culture that holds that business elites and government actors cannot be held accountable for corruption and malfeasance because it will “destabilize” the system. From pardons of presidents to too-big-to-fail banks to torturers getting the benefit of “not looking in the rearview mirror,” it’s hard to come up with an example of elite, institutional players having to face the music.<br />
<br />
But one of the more confounding aspects of this unaccountable culture of ours is the one that says the legal system has no responsibility to right its own wrongs or even admit to a lack of perfection even when it’s obvious they have made a grievous error (or broke the law). Yesterday I wrote about Justice <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/08/scalias_utter_moral_failure_how_he_destroys_any_claim_to_a_superior_system_of_justice/">Antonin Scalia’s rather shocking opinion</a> that the Constitution provides no avenue for an innocent person wrongfully condemned to be released if all the proper i’s were dotted and the t’s crossed.  That strikes me as a perverted definition of justice. But it goes even deeper than that.</blockquote>

Read on about one of those prosecutors and a discussion of how this ongoing lack of governmental accountability is perverting our society.<br />

Somebody get him a bottle and put him to bed. I'm afraid those gates were unlocked some time ago.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obamas-new-war-isis">in the adult corner</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This is the central irony of Obama’s speech—and, it must be said, of his approach. The caution that he has shown, the time that he has taken to reach a decision, are admirable and wise  the course of action that he has set out is, despite its increasing scope, narrowly targeted. (This is no war on terror or on radical Islam.) Even so, as he acknowledged last night, “we cannot do for Iraqis what they must do for themselves.” And there is, at this point, little to suggest that Iraqis can do much of anything for themselves but continue their slide into mutual mistrust and retributive violence. The security forces that Obama has now pledged to train, equip, and advise are seen, by many Sunnis, as a force of subjugation  Shiite militias, empowered by the previous Iraqi government and backed by Iran, have terrorized the population we intend to protect. The situation in Syria is less promising still. The anti-Assad rebels there have been unable to keep their weapons out of the hands of ISIS, which does raise the question: which side will we be arming?<br />
<br />
In this sense, last night’s peroration—with its ode to American exceptionalism—was beside the point. Not because America isn’t terrific, which it is, or because our “technology companies and universities” aren’t “unmatched,” which they are, but because America’s success in this new and important mission will not depend, in the last analysis, on our values, our strength, or our can-do spirit. It will depend on partners who are at best unreliable and possibly incapable. If they falter, what becomes of the U.S. effort? That question was neither asked nor answered in the President’s speech, but there is always next year.</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3249.htm">It's time for a little reminder of how we got here:</a><br />
<blockquote>
The neoconservative Project for a New American Century laid much of the groundwork for the foreign policy of the Bush administration. Its members received important postings in the White House, Department of Defense and other institutions. But what is seldom mentioned is that PNAC achieved its first great political victory during the Clinton administration when PNAC pushed Clinton to sign the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. <br />
<br />
In January 1998, the group wrote to Clinton: “[Y]ou have an opportunity to chart a clear and determined course for meeting this threat. We urge you to seize that opportunity, and to enunciate a new strategy that would secure the interests of the U.S. and our friends and allies around the world. That strategy should aim, above all, at the removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime from power.” <br />
<br />
The Iraq Liberation Act, backed overwhelmingly by Democrats and Republicans and signed by Clinton, made regime change in Iraq official US policy and set the course for the eventual invasion and occupation.</blockquote>
Also keep in mind the fact that the highly influential PNAC strategy document called Rebuilding America's Defenses was really no more than <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/etc/wolf.html">a warmed over version of the Cheney-Wolfowitz strategic defense document of 1992</a> that was rejected by ... well, everyone. They never gave up. They never do.<br />
<br />
It was this malign neoconservative influence that set everything in motion in Iraq and we are still paying the horrible price for that today. Al Qaeda existed apart from Saddam and would have been a threat regardless. But don't forget that the same people who pushed to invade Iraq for more than a decade forgot to put terrorism on its long list of threats. They always assumed that state power was the problem and they couldn't have been more wrong. As usual. And now we are mired in the Middle East even more deeply than before as the whole place burns down and nobody knows what's to take its place.<br />
<br />
The entire political establishment bears responsibility for this --- largely because they panicked after 9/11 and completely surrendered their good judgement and common sense. (That seems to be the reflexive response, unfortunately.) Still it's important to recall just who it was that planned and schemed and strategized for well over a decade to get the US militarily enmeshed in the region so deeply that it could never get out.<br />
<br />
This supremely confident group of failures is still out there, braying about American exceptionalism and the threat of the boogeyman coming to kill us all in our beds. And their influence is now fully woven into the national security state to the extent that nobody knows where they end and everyone else begins anymore. <i> But it doesn't change the fact that they have always been wrong about everything, </i>going all the way back to the 1970s when they were wrong about the Soviets and wrong about everything else. There has never been a more dangerously misguided faction in American politics. And yet, they just keep keeping on. <br />
