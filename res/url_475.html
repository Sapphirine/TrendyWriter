		<p>In 2008, when the US National Intelligence Council issued its latest report meant for the administration of newly elected President Barack Obama, it predicted that the planet's "sole superpower" would suffer a modest decline and a soft landing fifteen years hence. In his new book The United States of Fear, Tom Engelhardt makes clear that Americans should don their crash helmets and buckle their seat belts...</p>

		<p>At a time when the mainstream media leave out half of what the public  needs to know, while at the same time purveying oceans of official  nonsense, the public needs an alternative source of news. For years now,  Tom Engelhardt's Tomdispatch has been that for me. He is my mainstream.  Now he presents a series of brilliant interviews he has done for the  site, and they, taken as a whole, themselves form a searching chronicle  of our time.<br />--Jonathan Schell</p>

Mapping out what should more properly be called the Military  - Industrial - Technological - Entertainment - Scientific - Media -  Intelligence - Corporate Complex, historian Nick Turse demonstrates just  how extensively the Pentagon, through its little-noticed contacts (and  contracts) with America's major corporations, has taken hold of the  nation.</p>

See you there! Tom</em>]</p>
<p>It was June 12, 1982. My daughter was still in her stroller, my son  as yet unborn, when my wife and I, six friends, and another child in a  stroller joined an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tad-daley/nuclear-war-protest_b_1588344.html">estimated million people</a> in New York City at the largest antinuclear protest in history. All of  the adults in our party had grown up in a world unsettled in a unique  way: Armageddon had, for the first time, potentially become a secular  event. End times were no longer God&rsquo s choice for us, but ours for  ourselves. It seemed no mistake that, three decades into the Cold War,  the nuclear readiness of the two superpowers was referred to as &ldquo mutual  assured destruction,&rdquo  about as graphic a phrase as you could find for  the end of civilization  and, of course, it had its own acronym which,  to us at least, seemed less like an abbreviation than sardonic  commentary: MAD.</p>
<p>In 1979, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident">near-catastrophe</a> at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania helped launch a  new iteration of the antinuclear movement. Initially, it was focused on  &ldquo peaceful&rdquo  nuclear power, and then, amid a renewed superpower arms  race, on the potential destruction of the planet in a MAD conflagration   in the atmosphere of that moment, that is, we found ourselves living  with a renewed sense that the world might not be ours or anyone else&rsquo s  for long.</p>
<p>The first nuclear weapon had been detonated at the White Sands  Proving Ground in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, just four days before I  turned one, which meant world-ending <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKqXu-5jw60">fears</a> and dreams would be <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175811/tomgram%3A_ira_chernus,_what_ever_happened_to_plain_old_apocalypse/">woven</a> into <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/1666/tom_engelhardt_hiroshima_story">my life</a>. So, with a child of my own, it felt right to be in that giant crowd of protestors, marching near a contingent of <em>hibakusha</em>,  or survivors, from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic blasts that had,  thanks to America&rsquo s &ldquo victory weapon,&rdquo  ushered in the nuclear age.</p>
<p>In 1991, only nine years later, the Soviet Union, that other  superpower, would disappear. If you had told me then, with the Berlin  Wall down and not an enemy in sight, that almost a quarter of a century  later -- with two of our 1982 marchers dead -- most of the rest of us  would be planning to meet and march again, lest our children&rsquo s children  have no world worth living in, I would have been surprised indeed. And I  would have been no less surprised to learn that the U.S. and Russia  still preserve, <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/01/us-to-spend-1-trillion-on-nukes/">update</a>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/world/europe/us-says-russia-tested-cruise-missile-in-violation-of-treaty.html">upgrade</a> <a href="http://bos.sagepub.com/content/70/1/85.full.pdf+html">monstrous</a><strong> </strong>nuclear<strong> </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons">arsenals</a> that contain enough weapons to destroy a number of Earth-sized planets,  or that those weapons continue to proliferate globally, or that, as we  now know (given the &ldquo nuclear winter&rdquo  phenomenon), even a &ldquo modest&rdquo   regional nuclear exchange between <a href="http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/RobockToonSciAmJan2010.pdf">India and Pakistan</a> could result in an event of unimaginable horror for humanity. Told all  this, I would undoubtedly have wondered where the  then-much-talked-about post-Cold War &ldquo peace dividend&rdquo  had gone.</p>
<p>Had you also told me that, on September 21, 2014, I would be planning  to be out with my wife, my old friends, my son, my daughter, my  son-in-law, and my grandson marching in New York City, but this time  against a second human-produced potential apocalypse, and that it was  already happening in something like <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175811/tomgram%3A_ira_chernus,_what_ever_happened_to_plain_old_apocalypse/">slow motion</a>, I would have been stunned.</p>
<p>And yet so it is, and there I will be at the <a href="http://peoplesclimate.org/march/">People&rsquo s Climate March</a>,  and I wouldn&rsquo t be anywhere else that day. At some future moment,  wouldn&rsquo t it be sad to say that humanity&rsquo s greatest achievement was to  exploit to the fullest two energy sources -- the atom and fossil fuels  -- capable of destroying the basis for our lives on this planet, and  potentially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805092994/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">much other life</a> as well? What a strange possible epitaph for humanity: what we burned burned us.</p>
<p>At 70, this world won&rsquo t be mine for that much longer, so it&rsquo s not a  matter of my life or my planet, but I only have to look at my grandson  to know what&rsquo s at stake, to know that this is not the world he or his  peers deserve. To make global warming his inheritance could represent  the greatest crime in history, which means that those who run the giant  energy companies (and the oil states that go with them) and who know  better will be the <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175703/tomgram%3A_engelhardt,_the_biggest_criminal_enterprise_in_history/">ultimate criminals</a>.</p>
<p>No single march, of course, will alter the tide -- or perhaps I mean  the greenhouse gases -- of history, but you have to begin somewhere (and  then not stop). And to do so, you have to believe that the human  ability to destroy isn&rsquo t the best we have to offer and to remind  yourself of our ability to protest, to hope, to dream, to act, and to  say no to the criminals of history and yes to the children to come. <em>Tom</em></p>

<p>On Sunday, September 21st, a huge crowd will <a href="http://peoplesclimate.org/march/">march</a> through the middle of Manhattan. It will almost certainly be the  largest rally about climate change in human history, and one of the  largest political protests in many years in New York.

Instead,  it&rsquo s designed to serve as a loud and pointed reminder to our leaders,  gathering that week at the United Nations to discuss global warming,  that the next great movement of the planet&rsquo s citizens centers on our  survival and their pathetic inaction.</p>

					<p>Think of this as the year that democracy of, by, and for the  billionaires shall not perish from the Earth -- not when we&rsquo re on a new  electoral playing field in a political world in which distinctions are  no longer made between unlimited money and unlimited speech.&nbsp  In other  words, these days, if you have billions of dollars, you can shout from  the skies and the rest of us have to listen.&nbsp  If, as Steve Fraser points  out today, we&rsquo ve been witnessing the return of &ldquo family capitalism on  steroids,&rdquo  nowhere has it been bigger than in American politics, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-strikes-down-limits-on-federal-campaign-donations/2014/04/02/54e16c30-ba74-11e3-9a05-c7 f29ccb08_story.html">aided and abetted</a> by that ultimate family institution, the Supremes (and I'm not, of course, talking about the classic Motown group).</p>
<p>We&rsquo re still almost two months from the midterm elections in which the Republicans already have the House of Representatives <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/upshot/why-democrats-cant-win.html">essentially wrapped up</a> and ads for Senate races are zipping onto TV screens in &ldquo battleground  states&rdquo  at a dizzying pace. &nbsp To fund those ads and other campaign  initiatives, dollars by the millions are pouring into the coffers of  &ldquo dark money&rdquo  outfits in a way guaranteed to leave the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2012/10/2012-election-spending-will-reach-6/">record</a> for spending on midterm elections in a ditch at the side of the road.&nbsp   We now have our first estimates of what election 2014 is going to look  like as a billionaire&rsquo s playground  and count on it, you&rsquo re going to  hear the words &ldquo record,&rdquo  &ldquo billionaire,&rdquo  and &ldquo ads&rdquo  a lot more until  November.</p>
<p>&ldquo Outside groups&rdquo  have already spent <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=5425446">$120 million</a> on TV ads alone, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2014/09/outside-groups-dark-money-organizations-fuel-2014-midterms/">more than half</a> that sum coming from those dark-money groups that don&rsquo t have to let  anyone know who their contributors are.&nbsp  At the top of that shadowy list  are six outfits linked to David and Charles Koch, the billionaire  brothers from Wichita. Together, those groups have already sent a  mind-spinning <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/08/30/tom-steyer-considering-taking-on-democratic-candidates/">44,000 ads</a> into the politico-sphere in those battleground states, and the Kochs'  Americans for Prosperity (AFP) leads the pack with 27,000 of them. In  the end, AFP alone is expected to put $125 million into this year&rsquo s  midterm elections, a figure that should take your breath away and yet  that&rsquo s only a start.</p>
<p>Sheldon Adelson, of casino fame, may, for example, put <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/03/casino-tycoon-sheldon-adelson-takes-100-million-gamble-on-gop-senate.html">$100 million</a> of his $31.6 billion fortune into this campaign season, shuttling much  of it through dark-money outfits, including AFP. On the liberal side of  the spectrum, environmentalist and billionaire Tom Steyer has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/08/30/tom-steyer-considering-taking-on-democratic-candidates/">pledged</a> to sink $50 million into campaigns to promote candidates ready to act  on global warming (though there is little question that, in the  billionaire sweepstakes, the right-wing ones are going to <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/05/campaign-2014-hits-dark-money-record.html">outspend</a> the liberal ones, and Republicans outspend Democrats).</p>
<p>In all of this, you can see the urge of America's new crop of  billionaires to &ldquo play god&rdquo  at our expense and with our lives -- to  decide for us, ad by ad, dark-money outfit by dark-money outfit, how we  should organize ourselves politically. Historian Steve Fraser, <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175678/steve_fraser_making_disaster_pay">TomDispatch regular</a>, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300151438/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><em>Wall Street: America&rsquo s Dream Palace</em></a>, and co-founder (with me) of the <a href="http://www.americanempireproject.com/">American Empire Project</a>,  has rubbed elbows with many a billionaire -- on the page, if not in  life. From this country&rsquo s earliest tycoons to the latest batch of  family capitalists, he finds one overwhelming, unifying trait: a  deep-seated belief, in a country that worships self- or family-made  money, that the more billions you have, the more you should be listened  to. In his upcoming book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316185434/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><em>The Age of Acquiescence: The Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and Power</em></a>,  he explores how, in our second (even more) gilded age, others with  little money also came to believe that, rather than resist it. <em>Tom </em></p>

<p>George Baer was a railroad and coal mining magnate at the turn of the  twentieth century.&nbsp  Amid a violent and protracted strike that shut down  much of the country&rsquo s anthracite coal industry, Baer defied President  Teddy Roosevelt&rsquo s appeal to arbitrate the issues at stake, saying, &ldquo The  rights and interests of the laboring man will be protected and cared  for... not by the labor agitators, but by the Christian men of property  to whom God has given control of the property rights of the country.&rdquo &nbsp   To the Anthracite Coal Commission investigating the uproar, Baer  insisted, &ldquo These men don&rsquo t suffer. Why hell, half of them don&rsquo t even  speak English.&rdquo </p>
<p>We might call that adopting the imperial position.&nbsp  Titans of  industry and finance back then often assumed that they had the right to  supersede the law and tutor the rest of America on how best to order its  affairs.&nbsp  They liked to play God.&nbsp  It&rsquo s a habit that&rsquo s returned with a  vengeance in our own time.</p>

					<p>Is there nowhere on the face of the Earth where opinion polls aren&rsquo t  taken? In the wake of the 50-day Israeli assault on Gaza, parts of that  tiny strip of land now look, <a href="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1932781/thumbs/o-GAZA-900.jpg?1">according</a> to <a href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/26/14063686 883/4a77bf25-d410-421e-be -2f061c269a22-620x372.jpeg">photographs</a>, like a moonscape of destruction. At least <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2014/08/billion-destroyed-damaged.html">10,000 homes</a> were obliterated and thousands more damaged  at least <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/world/middleeast/after-conflict-gaza-industry-lies-in-ashes.html">175</a> major factories were pummeled into the dust. Its <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/29/gaza-power-plant-destroyed-israeli-airstrike-100-palestinians-dead">only power plant</a> was destroyed, damaging electricity, water, and sewage systems. Large <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/24/gaza-strikes-destroy-highrises">apartment houses</a>, as well as the ministry of education, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/10/gaza-schools">schools</a>,  and other sites, were hit and sometimes reduced to so much rubble. It  was all part of a massive Israeli assault on Hamas, several of whose <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/08/21/342118575/hamas-senior-leaders-killed-in-predawn-israeli-airstrike">senior leaders</a> were assassinated, but also on the Palestinian population, involving  what looked like collective punishment for its support of that  organization or simply living in proximity to it. And indeed, with  almost no hope of rebuilding much of their world <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/housing-group-says-20-years-rebuild-gaza-092845840.html">any time soon</a>,  you might think that Palestinians would hold the Hamas leadership at  least somewhat responsible for the destruction that has rained down, as  assumedly the Israelis wanted them to. But a <a href="http://www.pcpsr.org/en/special-gaza-war-poll">recent poll</a> by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR), begun  in the last day before the ceasefire took hold, and carried out, in  part, amid the rubble that is now Gaza, suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>It finds that Palestinian opinion couldn&rsquo t be clearer.&nbsp  Support  hasn&rsquo t been this high for Hamas since 2006, when it won a fair and  square democratic election. If a presidential vote were held today, the  pollsters of PSR discovered, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh would beat  Fatah&rsquo s Mahmoud Abbas hands down. Here are just a few of the findings:  &ldquo 79% [of Palestinians] believe that Hamas has won the Gaza War  3%  believe Israel came out the winner  and 17% believe the two sides were  losers... If new presidential elections are held today and only two  [candidates] were nominated, Haniyeh, for the first time since we have  started asking about his popularity about eight years ago, would receive  a majority of 61% and Abbas would receive 32%. [The] vote for Haniyeh  stands at 53% in the Gaza Strip and 66% in the West Bank. Abbas receives  43% in the Gaza Strip and 25% in the West Bank... A majority of 53%  believe that armed confrontation is the most effective means to  establish a Palestinian state next to the state of Israel. Only 22%  believe negotiation is the best means to establish a Palestinian state  and 20% believe that popular non-violent resistance is the most  effective route to statehood.&rdquo </p>
<p>As historically has often been the case, massive bombings and other  assaults do not destroy the support of populations for movements or  governments, but tend to solidify it. In other words, Israeli policy is  reducing civilized life for Palestinians in a major way and yet  increasing the urge both to fight on and the desire for revenge. It&rsquo s  an ugly pattern and, as <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175863/tomgram%3A_noam_chomsky,_america%27s_real_foreign_policy/">TomDispatch regular</a> Noam Chomsky (whose latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/160846363X/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><em>Masters of Mankind</em></a>,  is due out this week) indicates today, it&rsquo s been going on in this same  fashion for a remarkably long time, as Israel continues to gobble up  Palestinian lands on the West Bank, while working to hem Palestinians in  yet further in the Gaza Strip. <em>Tom</em></p>

<p><span style="font-size: x-large "><strong>Ceasefires in Which Violations Never Cease </strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: medium "><strong>What&rsquo s Next for Israel, Hamas, and Gaza? </strong></span><br />By <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/authors/noamchomsky">Noam Chomsky</a></p>
<p>On August 26th, Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) both  accepted a ceasefire agreement after a 50-day Israeli assault on Gaza  that left 2,100 Palestinians dead and vast landscapes of destruction  behind. The agreement calls for an end to military action by both  Israel and Hamas, as well as an easing of the Israeli siege that has  strangled Gaza for many years.</p>
<p>This is, however, just the most recent of a series of ceasefire  agreements reached after each of Israel's periodic escalations of its  unremitting assault on Gaza. Throughout this period, the terms of these  agreements remain essentially the same. &nbsp The regular pattern is for  Israel, then, to disregard whatever agreement is in place, while Hamas  observes it -- as Israel has officially recognized -- until a sharp  increase in Israeli violence elicits a Hamas response, followed by even  fiercer brutality. These escalations, which amount to shooting fish in a  pond, are called "mowing the lawn" in Israeli parlance. The most  recent was more accurately described as "removing the topsoil" by a  senior U.S. military officer, appalled by the practices of the  self-described "most moral army in the world."</p>

<p>In light of recent history, perhaps it&rsquo s time to update that classic U.S. Army <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDTPWgGfunM">recruitment campaign</a> slogan from &ldquo be all that you can be&rdquo  to &ldquo build all that you can  build.&rdquo &nbsp  Consider it an irony that, in an era when Congress struggles to  raise enough money to give America&rsquo s potholed, overcrowded highways a  helping hand, building new roads in Afghanistan proved no problem at all  (even when they led <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/afghanistans-multimillion-highway-to-nowhere-7922542.html">nowhere</a>).&nbsp  In fact, the U.S. military spent billions of taxpayer dollars in both Afghanistan and <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/07/09/196241/final-report-on-iraq-reconstruction.html">Iraq</a> on nation-building infrastructural efforts of all sorts, and the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction repeatedly reported on the failures,  disasters, and boondoggles that resulted.&nbsp  In 2012, for instance, that auditor  <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/07/28/war-on-waste-pentagon-auditor-spotlights-us-billions-blown-in-afghanistan/">found</a> that, of the $10.6 billion in Afghan funding it examined, $7 billion was  &ldquo potentially wasted.&rdquo &nbsp  And this has never ended.&nbsp  In 2014, it  typically reported that &ldquo some 285 buildings, including barracks, medical  clinics, and even fire stations built by the Army [in Afghanistan] are  lined with substandard spray insulation so prone to ignition that they  don't meet international building codes.&rdquo </p>
<p>As of this year, more U.S. and NATO money had been &ldquo <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/11004928/Afghanistan-has-cost-more-to-rebuild-than-Europe-after-Second-World-War.html">squandered</a>&rdquo   on the &ldquo reconstruction&rdquo  of Afghanistan than was spent on the full  post-World War-II Marshall Plan to put a devastated Europe back on its  feet.&nbsp  And how has all that spending turned out?&nbsp  One thing is certain:  those torrents of money helped create a devastating economy of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/world/asia/report-says-afghanistan-cant-be-trusted-to-prevent-misuse-of-us-aid.html">corruption</a>.&nbsp   As for reconstruction, the Inspector General found mainly &ldquo poor  planning, shoddy construction, mechanical failures, and inadequate  oversight.&rdquo  &nbsp </p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175878/tomgram%3A_nick_turse%2C_christmas_in_july_and_the_collapse_of_america%27s_great_african_experiment/">TomDispatch&rsquo s</a> Nick Turse, author of the <a href="http://www.beforecolumbusfoundation.com/">award-winning</a> book<em> Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam</em>,  reminds us today, thanks to the counterinsurgency strategy that the  U.S. military has pursued in these years, most of this spending came  under the heading of &ldquo winning hearts and minds&rdquo  in the countries the  U.S. invaded.&nbsp  Any American <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/03/AR2011010302175.html">batallion-level commander</a> in an Afghan village could essentially reach into his pocket and pull  out the funds to build a schoolhouse.&nbsp  And yet, in the United States,  much of our educational infrastructure, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/us-infrastructure-gets-d-in-annual-report/2013/03/19/c48cb010-900b-11e2-9cfd-36d6c9b5d7ad_story.html">built</a> after World War II for the Baby Boomer generation, is in need of reconstruction funds that are no longer in any <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp id=4011">pockets</a>.&nbsp  The same holds true for American airports (none having been built in almost 20 years), bridges (almost half of them <a href="http://t4america.org/maps-tools/bridges/overview/">needing</a> &ldquo major structural investments&rdquo  in the next 15 years and 11% now considered &ldquo structurally deficient&rdquo ), <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21605932-country-where-everyone-drives-america-has-shoddy-roads-bridging-gap">highways</a>, dams, levees, sewage and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/us/pipes-roads-and-walks-crack-as-los-angeles-defers-repairs.html">water systems</a>, and the like.&nbsp  In 2013, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the country&rsquo s infrastructure a <a href="http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/">grade of D+</a> and estimated that, to keep the U.S. a fully functioning first-world  country, some $3.6 trillion dollars would have to be invested in  infrastructural work by 2020.&nbsp </p>
<p>Fat chance.&nbsp  Though no one ever comments on it, the constant spending  of money to win hearts and minds in distant lands should be considered  passing strange when hearts and minds are at stake in Rhode Island,  Arkansas, and Oregon.&nbsp  Stranger yet, the group designated to do that  hearts-and-minds construction is also dedicated to destroying  infrastructure in times of conflict.&nbsp  It shouldn&rsquo t be surprising that  nation-building, school by school, road by road, might not be its strong  point.</p>
<p>Worse yet, as Nick Turse reports, continuing his remarkable ongoing <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175878/tomgram%3A_nick_turse%2C_christmas_in_july_and_the_collapse_of_america%27s_great_african_experiment/">investigation</a> into the U.S. military&rsquo s &ldquo <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175714/nick_turse_blowback_central">pivot</a>&rdquo   to Africa, even after the disasters of Afghanistan and Iraq, it seems  that there are hearts and minds still to win out there and all of Africa  to build in. <em>Tom</em></p>

<p>As I sit in a room filled with scores of high-ranking military  officers resplendent in their dress uniforms -- Kenyans in their khakis,  Burundians and Ugandans clad in olive, Tanzanians in deep forest green  sporting like-colored berets and red epaulets with crossed rifles on  their shoulders -- chances are that the U.S. military is carrying out  some mission somewhere on this vast continent.&nbsp  It might be a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/libya-condemns-us-raid-and-capture-of-bombing-suspect/2013/10/06/aad8b7ec-2ea6-11e3-8906-3daa2bcde110_story.html">kidnapping raid</a> or a <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175823/tomgram%3A_nick_turse,_america%27s_non-stop_ops_in_africa/">training exercise</a>.&nbsp  It could be an <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/26/world/africa/somalia-us-airstrike/">airstrike</a> or the construction of a <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175830/tomgram%3A_nick_turse,_africom_becomes_a_%22war-fighting_combatant_command%22">drone base</a>.&nbsp   Or, as I wait for the next speaker to approach the lectern at the &ldquo Land  Forces East Africa&rdquo  conference in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, it could be a  humanitarian operation run not by civilians in the aid business, but by  military troops with ulterior motives -- part of a near-continent-wide  campaign utilizing the core tenets of counterinsurgency strategy.</p>

					<p>Whatever you may imagine, &ldquo peak oil&rdquo  has not been discredited as a  concept, a statement no less true for &ldquo peak fossil fuels.&rdquo &nbsp  Think of  them instead as postponed.&nbsp  We are, after all, on a finite planet that,  by definition, holds a finite amount of oil, natural gas, and coal.&nbsp   Sooner or later, as such deposits get used up (no matter the new  techniques that might be invented to extract more of the ever tougher  stuff from the earth), we will reach a &ldquo peak&rdquo  of production from which  it will be all downhill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo s a simple fact to which, as it happens, there&rsquo s a catch.&nbsp  Here, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/science/earth/greenhouse-gas-emissions-are-growing-and-growing-more-dangerous-draft-of-un-report-says.html">according to</a> the <em>New York Times</em>,  is the key finding from the latest leaked 127-page draft report of the  U.N.&rsquo s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which manages  to use the word &ldquo risk&rdquo  <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/un-panel-global-warming-human-caused-dangerous">351 times</a>, &ldquo vulnerable&rdquo  or &ldquo vulnerability&rdquo  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-26/irreversible-damage-seen-from-climate-change-in-un-leak.html">61 times</a>,  and &ldquo irreversible&rdquo  48 times: &ldquo The report found that companies and  governments had identified reserves of these [fossil] fuels at least  four times larger than could safely be burned if global warming is to be  kept to a tolerable level.&rdquo </p>
<p>In other words, while &ldquo peak oil&rdquo  may be a perfectly on-target  concept, &ldquo peak existence&rdquo  turns out to precede it by decades and from  that far more consequential &ldquo peak&rdquo  we are, unlike &ldquo peak oil,&rdquo  already on  the downhill slide.&nbsp  The scientists who produced the IPCC's draft  report expect the average global temperature to increase by 3.6 degrees  Fahrenheit by mid-century and at least 6.7 degrees by its end, which  will leave humanity on a staggeringly less habitable planet.</p>
<p>The damage, including the melting of the Greenland ice shield, which  alone could raise global sea levels by an average of 23 feet, will be <a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/2014/08/28/global-warming-already-dangerous-may-be-irreversible-draft-ipcc-report">irreversible</a> (at least on a historical -- that is, human -- timescale).&nbsp  Faced with this relatively straightforward reality, as <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175865/tomgram%3A_michael_klare,_fighting_for_oil/">TomDispatch regular</a> Michael Klare, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/125002 71/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><em>The Race for What&rsquo s Left</em></a>,  reports today, oil companies are using remarkable ingenuity and  spending billions of dollars to reach ever deeper, ever more difficult  to extract, and ever more <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/business/shell-submits-a-plan-for-new-alaskan-arctic-oil-exploration.html">environmentally treacherous</a> deposits of fossil fuels.&nbsp  No less strikingly, the Obama administration  has been working energetically to pave the way for them to do so -- to,  that is, make real headway in removing those deposits four times larger  than will be even faintly comfortable for our future.&nbsp  Not only is it  doing so in a thoroughly drill-baby-drill spirit of cooperation with the  globe&rsquo s largest and most avaricious energy outfits, but it&rsquo s bragging  about it, too.&nbsp </p>
<p>In my childhood, I remember ads that fascinated me.&nbsp  I&rsquo m not sure  what they were selling or promoting, but they showed scenes of multiple  error, including, if I remember rightly, five-legged cows floating  through clouds.&nbsp  They were always tagged with some question like: What&rsquo s  wrong with this picture?&nbsp  Today, as in those ads, Klare offers us a  picture filled with the energy exploitation and global-warming  equivalent of those five-legged cows in the clouds and asks the same  question. <em>Tom</em></p>

<p><span style="font-size: x-large "><strong>Oil Is Back! </strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: medium "><strong>A Global Warming President Presides Over a Drill-Baby-Drill America</strong> </span><br />By <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/authors/michaelklare">Michael T. Klare</a></p>
<p>Considering all the talk about global warming, peak oil, carbon  divestment, and renewable energy, you&rsquo d think that oil consumption in  the United States would be on a downward path.&nbsp  By now, we should  certainly be witnessing real progress toward a post-petroleum economy.&nbsp   As it happens, the opposite is occurring.&nbsp  U.S. oil consumption is on an  upward trajectory, <a href="http://time.com/1387/us-oil-demand-grows-faster-than-china/">climbing by</a> 400,000 barrels per day in 2013 alone -- and, if current trends persist, it should <a href="http://eia.gov/forecasts/steo/">rise again</a> both this year and next.</p>
<p>In other words, oil is back.&nbsp  Big time.&nbsp  Signs of its resurgence  abound.&nbsp  Despite what you may think, Americans, on average, are driving <a href="http://eia.gov/forecasts/steo/">more miles</a> every day, not fewer, filling ever more fuel tanks with ever more  gasoline, and evidently feeling ever less bad about it.&nbsp  The stigma of  buying new gas-guzzling SUVs, for instance, seems to have vanished  <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/16/autos/SUVs-sales/index.htm">according to</a> CNN Money, nearly one out of three vehicles sold today is an SUV.&nbsp  As a result of all this, America&rsquo s demand for oil <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a168a5ac-827d-11e3-9d7e-00144feab7de.html">grew</a> more than China&rsquo s in 2013, the first time that&rsquo s happened since 1999.</p>
