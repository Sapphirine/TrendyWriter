His speeches were inspiring, his charisma unparalleled, his supporters a perfect mix of young and old, liberal and moderate."},{"type":"p","html":"“Barack blew me away,” says Tom Miller, Iowa’s longtime attorney general, who was one of the highest-ranking Democrats here to endorse Obama in 2008 and remains a strong supporter."},{"type":"p","html":"But when the conversation turned to Clinton, who is visiting Iowa for retiring Senator Tom Harkin’s famous “steak fry” on Sunday, the activists sounded more like political pundits. Nearly all of these activists said no other potential candidate is as experienced or qualified as the former secretary of state and first lady.

Many of them are deeply involved in politics and had one-on-one meetings with Obama and Clinton in 2007.

Some of the activists struggled to even name other candidates, except for Vice President Joe Biden, who several praised but only 1 of the 15 said they wanted to vote for over Clinton. Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley has impressed a handful of these activists, but others were unfamiliar with both him and Vermont Sen.

Potential Democratic candidates, wary of Clinton’s huge lead, are not meeting key Iowa activists as often as they did in the run-up to the 2008 primaries."},{"type":"p","html":"Miller himself, whose endorsement was highly sought in the 2008 cycle, said none of the potential candidates have requested personal meetings with him, although he has talked with O’Malley at Iowa Democratic events."},{"type":"p","html":"Another advantage for Clinton is that so far no issue seems to have galvanized Democrats in Iowa and raised the potential of someone running to Clinton’s right or left, as Obama did by emphasizing his opposition to the Iraq War in 2008. When asked what the most important issue the next president should confront, the answers from these activists were extremely varied. A handful mentioned foreign policy, with the rise of ISIS in the news this week.

As our colleague Andrea Mitchell put it so well: This is hardly the legacy that President Obama wanted. And it helps to explain why it took him so long to announce it. In his primetime speech from the White House, the president said the campaign against ISIS would be a sustained counterterrorism strategy similar to how the administration is combating terrorism in places like Yemen and Somalia -- with airstrikes and support but no U.S. combat troops. He said the United States had assembled a coalition to fight ISIS, with the Iraqi government, Kurdish forces and moderate Syrians providing the manpower. He called on Congress to authorize resources to train and equip the Syrian opposition. And he admitted the campaign wouldn’t be a short one. Indeed, as the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/world/middleeast/extending-a-legacy-of-war.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=LedeSum&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">New York Times’ Baker writes</a>, Obama will likely be leaving this war to his successor in office. All of this “may have ensured that he would pass his successor a volatile and incomplete war, much as his predecessor left one for him.”"},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Unanswered questions from last night</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Obama’s plan to combat ISIS presents as many questions as answers. What does success look like? (If Yemen and Somalia are the examples, it’s worth noting that the campaigns there have, at best, degraded the terrorists but have hardly destroyed them.) What do you do with Assad? And how does this all end? In fact, that last question points to perhaps the biggest shortcoming from Obama’s speech. How long does this last? And at what cost? We didn’t get those answers last night."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Tempered praise from Republicans</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Despite those unanswered questions, here’s the most interesting part from last night’s speech: It got more Republican support than anything Obama has done in his second term. “I support the president taking military action in Iraq and Syria to combat this organization. I also support his request for additional authority to support the moderate, vetted Syrian opposition. But more must be done,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. Added Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham: “While we strongly disagree with President Obama that America is safer today than five years ago, his speech tonight got some key things right. He explained to the American people why we must confront ISIS.” Yes, Republicans took some shots at the president. And, yes, some have disagreed with him taking U.S. combat forces off the table. But it’s been a long time since so many Republicans have showered this much praise -- no matter how tempered -- on the president. And for their part, Democratic leaders were pretty complimentary as well, though other Dems <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/217379-democrats-split-on-obamas-plans-for-isis\">were split on the speech</a>. In short, Obama will have Congress’ support taking the fight to ISIS. But sustaining it over months and years? That will be tougher."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Security pendulum swings back</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"On this anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, note that it’s just not our NBC/WSJ poll showing that the security pendulum has swung back with the ISIS news in the headlines. According to a new <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2014/09/10/growing-concern-about-rise-of-islamic-extremism-at-home-and-abroad/\">Pew poll</a>, 50% of Americans say U.S. anti-terror policies haven't gone FAR ENOUGH to protect the country, vs. 35% who say they've gone TOO FAR in restricting civil liberties. That's a significant reversal from last year after the Snowden revelations. In July 2013, Americans by a 47%-35% margin said that anti-terror policies had gone too far. And the numbers were similar in Nov. 2013: 44% said they had gone too far, while 39% said they hadn't gone far enough."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Gender gap still keeping Democrats in the game</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Yesterday we wrote how our NBC/WSJ poll showed Democrats at the tipping point of big losses this midterm season. But the poll also revealed a silver lining that could limit their losses: the gender gap. In our latest survey, women preferred a Democratic-controlled Congress by seven points, 47%-40%. Although that’s down from our previous polls and although Republicans have an ever bigger lead among men (12 points), do note that our Sept. 2010 NBC/WSJ poll showed Democrats with just a three-point edge among female voters, 46%-43%. Bottom line: Democrats holding on to the Senate will largely come down to whether they win women by double digits in November. Another voting bloc keeping Democrats in the game: independents. Our poll had Republicans with a three-point lead among indies, 33%-30%, which is down from their 14-point advantage in Sept. 2010."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Looking at the Latino vote</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Our poll also included an NBC/WSJ/Telemundo oversample among Latino voters (336 were interviewed), and the findings are striking.

(And FYI: Much of the poll was conducted BEFORE Obama’s announcement that he was postponing any executive action on immigration until after the midterm elections.) That said, Latino voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress by a 61%-28% margin, which is almost unchanged from the 65%-23% score from Oct. 2012.
