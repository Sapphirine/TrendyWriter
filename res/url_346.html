I could easily have done it: Democrats back were as likely as not to be philosophically opposed to market-based mechanisms. Those of us of a neoliberal bent who back then thought that often market-based mechanisms were the best means of achieving social-democratic ends were not as unwelcome in the Democratic Party as it stood at the end of the 1970s as reality-based technocrats are in today's Republican Party. But it was clear in the early 1980s that the Democratic Party's activist base were not about to start slaughtering the fatted calf for us--let alone the ring, sandals, merriment, and best robe part. Besides, back then the Democratic Party's deformations back then seemed to be something that smart economists could help fix. The Republican Party's deformations back then, not so much.</p>

				<p>No. That is not what Derek writes. But it is what he should write:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://delong.typepad.com/.a/6a00e551f08003883401a5119bb58d970c-pi" alt="Preview of How Rich and Poor Americans Spend" title="Preview_of_“How_Rich_and_Poor_Americans_Spend”.png" border="0" width="500" /></p>

<p><strong>Derek Thompson:</strong> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/04/how-the-rich-and-poor-spend-money-today-and-30-years-ago/360103/">How the Rich and Poor Spend Money Today—and 30 Years Ago:</a> "The biggest difference between the lowest- and highest-earning Americans...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...is what they spend on housing. Less than 40 percent of the bottom quintile owns a home, compared with 90 percent of Americans at the top. As a result, the top quintile outspends the bottom on housing by $21,000 a year (remember: that gap alone is basically the entire budget of a lower-income family) and $13,000 more on transportation. At just about every income level, we spend about half our income on living and getting around. But after houses and transportation, what are the biggest spending gaps between the top and bottom quintiles today? The poor spend nearly twice as much (as a share of their budget) on food at home and utilities; the rich spend more on entertainment and education.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we see one reason for the very different perceptions of how things are going held by the rich and the non-rich. Not only have the incomes and wealth of those who occupy the "rich" slots in the income and wealth distribution been vastly outstripping the "non-rich", but of the things that the rich differentially spend a large share on one--education--has become much more expensive <em>but as its cost has gone up its monetary and class-marker benefit has gone up as well</em>, and the other--entertainment--has seen its cost plummet extraordinarily.</p>

<p>Cheaper electronic toys are worth a great deal to the rich. There has been no similar price revolution in housing, transportation, food at home, and utilities; the rise in the cost of education is perceived to have put opportunity further out of reach; and the fear of medical bankruptcy has grown.</p>

				<p><strong>Dietz Vollrath:</strong> <a href="http://growthecon.wordpress.com/2014/09/12/taxes-and-growth/">Taxes and Growth:</a> "William Gale and Andy Samwick have a new Brookings paper out...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...on the relationship of tax rates and economic growth.... They do not identify any change in the trend growth rate of real GDP per capita with changes in marginal income tax rates, capital gains tax rates, or any changes in federal tax rules.... Stokey and Rebelo (1995).... You can see that the introduction of very high tax rates during WWII, which effectively became permanent features of the economy after that, did not change the trend growth rate of GDP per capita in the slightest. The only difference after 1940 in the lower panel is that the fluctuations in the economy are less severe.... Taxes as a percent of GDP don’t appear to have any relevant relationship to growth rates.... Hungerford (2012)... looks at whether the fluctuations in top marginal tax rates (on either income or capital gains) are related to growth rates. You can see in the figure that they are not. If anything, higher capital gains rates are associated with faster growth.... There is no evidence that you can change the growth rate of the economy--up or down--by changing tax rates--up or down. Their conclusion is more coherent than anything I could gin up, so here goes: 'The argument that income tax cuts raise growth is repeated so often that it is sometimes taken as gospel. However, theory, evidence, and simulation studies tell a different and more complicated story. Tax cuts offer the potential to raise economic growth by improving incentives to work, save, and invest. But they also create income effects that reduce the need to engage in productive economic activity, and they may subsidize old capital, which provides windfall gains to asset holders that undermine incentives for new activity.'"</p>

<p><strong>Daniel Kuehn:</strong> <a href="http://factsandotherstubbornthings.blogspot.com/2014/04/kuehn-smackdown-watch-bastiat-edition.html?showComment=1398186778823#c7385478442989640442">Facts &amp; Other Stubborn Things: Kuehn Smackdown Watch: Bastiat Edition"</a> "Brad DeLong thinks that Bastiat would be a modern liberal...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...(I had said the other day that he likely would be a libertarian but that Smith, Jefferson, Locke, Paine, etc. were classical liberals that would very plausibly be left-liberals today). I think he makes a good case. I've discussed many of the passages he presents to make the claim here, and I think they are important for libertarian fans of Bastiat especially to be aware of. And anyone that's followed the blog for a few years know that I think most modern invocations of the broken window are God-awful and that Bastiat's understanding of general equilibrium is far more sophisticated and closer to people like me or Krugman who make important distinctions between stocks and flows (wealth and income) in arbitrating the effects of, for example, a disaster.</p>
  
  <p>I would only say this in my defense (because I still think he would be more of a libertarian, simply due to the center of gravity of his commentary): he would certainly be more of a libertarian in the vein of Hayek of the <em>Constitution of Liberty</em> or <em>Law, Legislation, and Liberty</em> than a libertarian like Bob Murphy (for example).</p>

				<p>I do indeed think that Nick Rowe's thought is 100% correct here--with perhaps the proviso that other people might not like his definition of what a 'recession' is...</p>

<p>**Nick Rowe: <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2014/09/whats-special-about-monetary-coordination-failures.html">What's special about monetary coordination failures?:</a> "This is a response to Brad DeLong's and David Glasner's good posts...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...[that] forced me to think.... Apples and bananas are perishable, but gold lasts forever. One apple tree produces 100 apples per year, regardless. One banana tree produces 100 bananas per year, regardless. Trees cannot be produced. Gold cannot be produced. Gold is the medium of account. Apples and bananas are priced in gold. Those prices may be sticky.... </p>
  
  <p>There are two parallel economies... a barter economy... a monetary exchange economy.... For the second shock (a change in preferences away from apples towards bananas), we get the same reduction in the volume of trade whether we are in a barter or a monetary economy. Monetary coordination failures play no role in this sort of 'recession'. But would we call that a 'recession'? Well, it doesn't look like a normal recession, because there is an excess demand for bananas. For both the first and third shocks, we get a reduction in the volume of trade in a monetary economy, and none in the barter economy. Monetary coordination failures play a decisive role in these sorts of recessions, even though the third shock that caused the recession was not a monetary shock. It was simply... because agents became more patient. And these sorts of recessions do look like recessions, because there is an excess supply of both apples and bananas.... </p>
  
  <p>P.S.: I think this is all in Benassy, somewhere. P.P.S.: If you said 'this is all ISLM, only ISLM with and without barter', you would be basically right...</p>

				<p><strong>Dylan Matthews:</strong> <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/13/6135905/open-borders-bryan-caplan-interview-gdp-double>The Case for Open Borders:</a> "'What would you think about a law...</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>...that said that blacks couldn’t get a job without the government’s permission, or women couldn’t get a job without the government’s permission, or gays or Christians or anyone else?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>George Mason economist Bryan Caplan asks. It's a pretty easy question. Obviously, such a law is discriminatory on its face, serves no rational purpose, and is unacceptable in a liberal democracy. But Caplan continues:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>So why, exactly, is it that people who are born on the wrong side of the border have to get government permission just to get a job?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>This is Caplan's elevator pitch for open borders, an idea that for years was treated as deeply unserious, as an extreme straw man that nativists could beat up in the course of resisting more modest efforts to help immigrants. It had its defenders--philosopher Joseph Carens primary among them--but they were relatively lonely voices...</p>

We try to answer this question by analyzing the cross sectional and time series variation in pro-European sentiment in the EU 15 countries. The two major steps forward (the 1992 Maastricht Treaty and the 2004 enlargement) seem to have reduced the pro-Europe sentiment as does the 2010 Eurozone crisis. Yet, in spite of the worst recession in recent history, the Europeans still support the common currency.

First, demographic trends are less favourable. Second, revenues from the North Sea are expected to decline.... The SNP do not agree.... The main reason in the near term is that they have more optimistic projections for North Sea Oil.... So how do the Scottish government get more optimistic numbers? John McDermott examines the detail here, but perhaps I can paraphrase his findings: whenever there is room for doubt, assume whatever gives you a higher number.... Governments that try to borrow today in the hope of a more optimistic future are not behaving very responsibly.... Is this a knock down argument in favour of voting No? Of course not: there is nothing wrong in making a short term economic sacrifice for the hope of longer term benefits or for political goals. But that is not the SNP’s case.... I kept thinking I had seen this kind of thing before: being in denial about macroeconomic fundamentals because they interfered with a major institutional change that was driven by politics. Then I realised what it was: the formation of the Euro in 2000.... So maybe that also explains why I feel so strongly this time around. I have no political skin in this game: a certain affection for the concept of the union, but nothing strong enough to make me even tempted to distort my macroeconomics in its favour. If Scotland wants to make a short term economic sacrifice in the hope of longer term gains and political freedom that is their choice. But they should make that choice knowing what it is, and not be deceived into believing that these costs do not exist."</p></li>

Hong Kong... Shenzhen... Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong.... Average incomes in Guangdong are just a quarter of those in Hong Kong, equivalent to Algeria or Costa Rica. Finally... the tributaries reach across Guangxi into Yunnan.... Incomes there are but a tenth of those in Hong Kong, on a par with those in Angola or the Republic of the Congo. Over the past 15 years the currents that take people from such hinterlands of poverty to the broad open reaches of wealth have been flowing at an unprecedented rate.... This burst of growth struck an extraordinary blow against deprivation.... [But] since 2008 growth rates across the emerging world have slipped back toward those in advanced economies. When the new ICP estimates are applied, the average GDP per head in the emerging world, measured on a purchasing-power-parity (PPP) basis, grew just 2.6 percentage points faster than American GDP in 2013. If China is excluded from the calculations the difference is just 1.1 percentage points. At that pace convergence with rich-economy incomes happens over a period of time more like a century than a generation.... In 1997, just before the great catch-up got into its swing, the World Bank’s senior economist, Lant Pritchett, described a widening income gap between rich and poor countries as 'the dominant feature of modern economic history'. Its dominance was rendered particularly galling by the fact that orthodox economics struggled to explain it.... [But] the world shifted beneath economists’ feet as growth in the developing world shot up from the end of the 1990s. A great deal of this was due to the rise of China as a manufacturing superpower, but that was far from being the whole story.... It looks like the world is now being reminded that catching up is hard to do."</p></li>

Tax rate cuts may encourage individuals to work, save, and invest, but if the tax cuts are not financed by immediate spending cuts they will likely also result in an increased federal budget deficit, which in the long-term will reduce national saving and raise interest rates. The net impact on growth is uncertain, but many estimates suggest it is either small or negative. Base-broadening measures can eliminate the effect of tax rate cuts on budget deficits... at the same time they also reduce the impact on labor supply, saving, and investment and thus reduce the direct impact on growth. However, they also reallocate resources across sectors... resulting in increased efficiency.... Not all tax changes will have the same impact on growth. Reforms that improve incentives, reduce existing subsidies, avoid windfall gains, and avoid deficit financing will have more auspicious effects on the long-term size of the economy, but may also create trade-offs between equity and efficiency."</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>What the hell do you think spies are? Moral philosophers measuring everything they do against the word of God or Karl Marx? They’re not! They’re just a bunch of seedy, squalid bastards like me: little men, drunkards, queers, hen-pecked husbands, civil servants playing cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten little lives.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>So says disillusioned British secret agent Alec Leamas (Richard Burton) in perhaps the best effort to adapt a John le Carré novel to the big screen: 1965′s <em>The Spy Who Came in From the Cold</em>. The serpentine plot concerns a burnt-out espionage agent who enters a downward spiral of booze, self-hatred and lost faith after a disastrous mission in Berlin. But then it turns out that Leamas’ decline and despair is a ruse (?) play-acted at the behest of his superiors. As planned, he is recruited by the other side and ends up trying to discredit East German intelligence head Hans-Dieter Mundt (A cold, effective Peter van Eyck). Leamas undermines the ex-Nazi by feeding false (??) information to Mundt’s ambitious, Jewish deputy (Oskar Werner, very strong here). It’s a difficult, high-risk mission, but Leamas knows that his boss back home is 100% behind him (???).</p>

				<p>From Sewell Tyng: <em>The Campaign of the Marne</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite minor frictions, the German armies at last arrived upon the positions which they were destined to hold without substantial change until the spring of 1918; but Von Moltke had still to drain the dregs of his cup of humiliation, for this day was his last as Chief of the German General Staff. At the suggestion, it is said, of the younger officers of von Moltke's own Operations Section who had lost all confidence in their chief, and impelled by the officers of the Imperial military household, the Emperor summoned von Moltke and informed him that the state of his health was too precarious for the heavy responsibilities devolving upon him. The same day von Falkenhayn, the Prussian Minister of War, assumed the duties of the Chief of the General Staff, and von Stein, superseded by von Freytag-Loringhoven as Quartermaster-General, was sent to command an army corps. </p>

Policymakers can view some of the current low level of the participation rate as indicative of labor market slack beyond that indicated by the unemployment rate alone, they should not expect the participation rate to show a substantial increase from current levels as labor market conditions continue to improve...</p>

				<p><strong>Simon Wren-Lewis:</strong> <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2014/09/scotland-and-snp-fooling-yourselves-and.html">Scotland and the SNP: Fooling yourselves and deceiving others:</a> "Scotland’s fiscal position would be worse...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...as a result of leaving the UK for two main reasons. First, demographic trends are less favourable. Second, revenues from the North Sea are expected to decline.... The SNP do not agree.... The main reason in the near term is that they have more optimistic projections for North Sea Oil.... So how do the Scottish government get more optimistic numbers? John McDermott examines the detail here, but perhaps I can paraphrase his findings: whenever there is room for doubt, assume whatever gives you a higher number.... Governments that try to borrow today in the hope of a more optimistic future are not behaving very responsibly.... Is this a knock down argument in favour of voting No? Of course not: there is nothing wrong in making a short term economic sacrifice for the hope of longer term benefits or for political goals. But that is not the SNP’s case.... I kept thinking I had seen this kind of thing before: being in denial about macroeconomic fundamentals because they interfered with a major institutional change that was driven by politics. Then I realised what it was: the formation of the Euro in 2000.... So maybe that also explains why I feel so strongly this time around. I have no political skin in this game: a certain affection for the concept of the union, but nothing strong enough to make me even tempted to distort my macroeconomics in its favour. If Scotland wants to make a short term economic sacrifice in the hope of longer term gains and political freedom that is their choice. But they should make that choice knowing what it is, and not be deceived into believing that these costs do not exist.</p>

  <p>...or do they create a political backlash? We try to answer this question by analyzing the cross sectional and time series variation in pro-European sentiment in the EU 15 countries. The two major steps forward (the 1992 Maastricht Treaty and the 2004 enlargement) seem to have reduced the pro-Europe sentiment as does the 2010 Eurozone crisis. Yet, in spite of the worst recession in recent history, the Europeans still support the common currency. Europe seems trapped in catch-22: there is no desire to go backward, no interest in going forward, but it is economically unsustainable to stay still.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just wanted to push back a little against the claim that the Eurocrisis was an unexpected perfect storm, and praise Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas and even more Marty Feldstein for warning us of this fifteen years ago, but I won't because I think Mervyn King's should be the last word here.</p>

'Our cohort-based model suggests that cyclical weakness was depressing the participation rate by about ¼ percentage point in 2014:Q2'.... The wider issue is that trends thought to be structural aren’t necessarily irreversible.... The dovish argument, to which we still subscribe, is that the only way to know is for the Fed to aggressively pursue [expansion until]... the labour market becomes so tight that employers feel they have no choice but to make work more attractive.... Year-on-year headline PCE inflation is 1.6 per cent through July, the last available reading--which also happens to be its average rate since the recession. That’s not only an extended period of undershooting 2 per cent, but also a staggering demand fail given what happened to labour markets in that period.... To further make incoming data, rather than time, the clear contingency on which to base monetary policy would be perfectly sensible...</p></li>

Market participants in 'direct enforcement; states that ceded all enforcement of the ACA to the federal government are worse off by approximately $245 per participant on an annualized basis relative to participants in all other states.... Market participants in the six states that had severe exchange glitches are worse off by approximately $750 per participant on an annualized basis relative to participants in other states with their own exchanges..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lucia Foster, Cheryl Grim, and John Haltiwanger:</strong> <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w20427">Reallocation in the Great Recession: Cleansing or Not?:</a> "The high pace of reallocation across producers is pervasive in the U.S. economy. Evidence shows this high pace of reallocation is closely linked to productivity. While these patterns hold on average, the extent to which the reallocation dynamics in recessions are “cleansing” is an open question. We find downturns prior to the Great Recession are periods of accelerated reallocation even more productivity enhancing than reallocation in normal times. In the Great Recession, we find the intensity of reallocation fell rather than rose and the reallocation that did occur was less productivity enhancing than in prior recessions."</p></li>

In his 2014 budget, President Obama proposed changing the price index with which retiree benefits are adjusted for inflation. In brief, the change was expected to lower the growth rate of benefits for all retirees, though at advanced ages that change would have been offset by progressive "benefit enhancements." Because it was not tied to an increase in the starting level of those benefits, the Presidentís proposal was expected to reduce the total present value of benefits. The President's proposal was explicitly intended to appeal to Congressional Republicans eager to reduce future spending on Social Security, but it was deeply unpopular with many of his fellow Democrats. When negotiations on more general fiscal policy challenges yielded little progress over the subsequent year, the President removed the proposal from his 2015 budget. His spokesperson made clear, however, that changes to indexation were still on the table if included in broader budget deals..."</p></li>

It seems likely that new generations internalized many of these changes more easily than did mature cohorts, who had already made “sticky” choices.... Much of the change in the aggregate female participation rate appears to have resulted from progressively higher average participation rates of successive cohorts..... The participation rate for men in their prime working years... held steady during the strong labor market of the mid- to late-1990s. After turning down again during the 2001 recession, it has been fairly flat since 2002..."</p></li>

Besides, as a theoretical conjecture, it needs working through. Before we accept Minsky’s verbal conjecture, what would an artificial economy do if you peopled it with agents with imperfect apprehensions of risk? Would such artificial systems be characterised by a ‘stability is destabilising’ dynamic?... If you follow Paul Krugman’s reasoning, the financial crisis, at least as manifest in spreads, is over and done with.  And it’s lasting consequences for demand and inflation are down to insufficiently stabilising fiscal policy.  There’s no room for a ‘stability is destabilising’ dynamic here.  The future would be bright if Governments simply spent more money raising the natural rate. But suppose we accept the idea at face value. One reading of it suggests that we restricting bank leverage as Martin Wolf urges won’t work by itself.  A long period of stability breeding complacency would presumably erode the support for these restrictions..."</p></li>

				<p>First:</p>

<p>Let me try to widen the scope of this discussion...</p>

<p>When I think about vehicles to provide retirement-income security...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I think that encouraging people to invest in 401(k)s leads them, because of poor financial education, to pay a 2%/year tax on their asset accumulations to Wall Street--a transfer that is 100% a dissipative minus for any utilitarian societal welfare calculation given how rich the princes of Wall Street already are.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that having firms provide defined-benefit pensions hasn't worked out that well in the long run: firms do not survive long enough, and if they do along comes Bain Capital to exploit the legal gap between the cash-flow and the control rights of future pension beneficiaries and put the scraps of the mostly-expropriated pension assets to the PBGC.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that Social Security indexed to prevailing wages provides an extraordinarily efficient way of providing a form of retirement savings that--given the enormous risk premia we see in financial markets--value extremely high. If we were to ask, say, Citicorp here how much it would charge to write a contract matching the return on your Social Security benefits, it would be astronomical. The only major drawback of relying more on Social Security that gives me pause is Marty Feldstein's long-time worries about the effect of Social Security on national capital accumulation and thus on the level of economy-wide real wages.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Given that the first rule of market economics is that you should do less of what dissipates wealth and more of what creates wealth, I am--as I have long been--somewhat puzzled by the focus here... </p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>When back in 1994 Joe Stiglitz came up with the bright or perhaps not-so-bright idea of proposing changes in the Social Security benefits indexation formula, the key piece was tying changes in Social Security benefits indexation to changes in tax bracket breakpoints. This was both because it made sense to view the social-insurance system as a whole--both taxes and benefits--and as a way to assemble a proposal that would make it past the multiple veto points of our eighteenth-century mechanistic orrery of a governmental system and also increase utilitarian societal welfare. So if I may channel Joe Stiglitz, I think he would say that there ought, somewhere, to be a wealth tax component to this proposal somewhere. If there were, what would it be?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...across producers is pervasive in the U.S. economy. Evidence shows this high pace of reallocation is closely linked to productivity. While these patterns hold on average, the extent to which the reallocation dynamics in recessions are “cleansing” is an open question. We find downturns prior to the Great Recession are periods of accelerated reallocation even more productivity enhancing than reallocation in normal times. In the Great Recession, we find the intensity of reallocation fell rather than rose and the reallocation that did occur was less productivity enhancing than in prior recessions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I looked at this, it seemed to me that it made a <em>lot</em> of difference whether your unit of observation was the firm or the worker. The average existing <em>firm</em> did indeed become more productive in a recession, in part through "shooting the wounded" and in part because the fear of being hanged tomorrow concentrates a person's mind remarkably. But the average <em>worker</em> and the average unit of <em>capital</em> became less productive: after all, can you think of something worse for overall economic efficiency than shifting workers into the "unemployed" sector and shifting capital into the "idle" sector?</p>

<p>And, no, I do not have an explanation of why the <strike>financial crisis</strike> <strike>Great Recession</strike> <strong>Lesser Depression</strong> was destructive of average productivity at the firm level...</p>

				<p>Comment on: <strong>Janice Eberly and Arvind Krishnamurthy:</strong> <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Fall 2014/Fall2014BPEA_Agenda.pdf">Efficient Credit Policies in a Housing Debt Crisis:</a></p>

<p>The banks got at lot of money very cheaply--5%/year preferred-stock money giving up neither equity nor debt control rights at a time when Warren Buffett, front-running the Treasury, was able to extract 10%/year plus enormous option kickers for the money he committed to bank rescue. The auto companies--they got money, but the unions took a substantial hit, and the top executives lost their jobs. The homeowners got...</p>

<p>It still is a mystery to me why we did not offer all underwater and above water homeowners a conforming-loan refi with equity kickers depending on how far underwater the homeowner was. We didn't do that. We got rid of the debt overhang via foreclosures and (some) case-by-case renegotiations, and as Paul Willen says it was brutal and ugly.</p>

<p>But right now... we built, during the housing bubble, about 1 million single-family houses above trend. Since 2007 we have built between 500 and 600 thousand houses per year when long-run trend used to be 1.2 million a year. Netting out the 1 million extra houses built, we are now 4 million single-family houses short--4 million families who in a normal economy would be in their own homes are now living in their sisters' basements, with little sign that the by-now enormous underhang relative to 1948-2008 housing trends is exerting any pressure for a single-family housing construction recovery.</p>

<p>SO why is this? Are potential homeowners unwilling to take on the types of risk they routinely took on? Is it lenders who are unwilling to take on the types of risk they routinely took on? Of course it is both. But what is clear is we haven't unclogged the single-family housing credit channel. And the question is: is this an enormous social loss? Or should we never have established the previous housing-finance pattern in the first place?</p>

				<p><strong>Cardiff Garcia:</strong> <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/09/11/1957671/slacking-to-stand-still/">Slacking to Stand Still:</a> "A paper released last week by [Stephanie Aaronson et al.]... concludes that most of the decline in the labour force participation rate since the recession has been structural.... 'Our cohort-based model suggests that cyclical weakness was depressing the participation rate by about ¼ percentage point in 2014:Q2'...</p>

<p>As I said before, this smells to me like overfitting: I want a reconciliation with Moffitt et al. (2012) and also a much better reconciliation with the behavior of the prime-aged participation rate as well:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://delong.typepad.com/.a/6a00e551f08003883401b8d0680707970c-pi" alt="NewImage" title="NewImage.png" border="0" width="550" height="467" /></p>

<p>To quote <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/spring%202006/2006a_bpea_aaronson.pdf">Aaronson et al. (2006)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Increases in the participation rate of adult women likely stem from numerous structural factors.... It seems likely that new generations internalized many of these changes more easily than did mature cohorts, who had already made “sticky” choices.... Much of the change in the aggregate female participation rate appears to have resulted from progressively higher average participation rates of successive cohorts..... The participation rate for men in their prime working years... held steady during the strong labor market of the mid- to late-1990s. After turning down again during the 2001 recession, it has been fairly flat since 2002.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not the lead-in that would lead us to expect a conclusion that the 2.5%-point decline in prime-age participation since 2007 is "structural"...</p>

<p>Cardiff goes on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The wider issue is that trends thought to be structural aren’t necessarily irreversible.... The dovish argument, to which we still subscribe, is that the only way to know is for the Fed to aggressively pursue [expansion until]... the labour market becomes so tight that employers feel they have no choice but to make work more attractive.... Year-on-year headline PCE inflation is 1.6 per cent through July, the last available reading--which also happens to be its average rate since the recession. That’s not only an extended period of undershooting 2 per cent, but also a staggering demand fail given what happened to labour markets in that period.... To further make incoming data, rather than time, the clear contingency on which to base monetary policy would be perfectly sensible...</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                    <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>One of the things that holds our society together is that our arms-length market transactions are not completely arms-length--that in nearly all (except our transactions with used-car salesmen and financial-market counterparties) have some element of reciprocal social solidarity-generating gift-exchange in them.</p>

<p>To try to break that is not "hospitality"--is not treating somebody like a guest. It is, rather, the reverse.</p>

<p>And so Kevin Drum is annoyed:</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Drum:</strong> <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/09/brief-note-texas-hospitality">A Brief Note on Texas Hospitality</a> "Jay Nordlinger had an unusual experience...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...with a taxi wrangler at the Dallas airport yesterday:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>The man put my suitcase in a taxi’s trunk. I handed him a tip. He said, “No, no, we’re not allowed to take that.”I have been a fair number of places over the years — and I bet I could count refusals of a tip on one hand.... There is something I tell people who think they don’t like Texas: Just go there. That’ll cure you. Texas is distinctively hospitable, and the food, girls, etc., cannot be surpassed (though they can be matched).</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>For what it's worth, 'hospitable' is not the same thing as 'airport authorities don't allow employees to accept tips.' The former is a trait of people who are just being nice. The latter is something that CEOs force on their low-paid employees. There's a difference.</p>

This appears counterintuitive: All else equal, falling rates of unemployment should prompt faster wage growth. Several potential explanations have been offered.... One is that the unemployment rate could be sending a false signal about the amount of slack in the job market. Another... blames pent-up wage deflation... firms could not cut nominal wages by as much as they wanted during the recession, and are thus reluctant to raise wages now.... Because the economies of U.S. states experienced different rates of recession and recovery, they offer a laboratory in which to test the pent-up wage deflation hypothesis.... In six states the unemployment rates are below NAIRU, while in four states it is 1.5 percentage points above full employment.... The pent-up wage deflation hypothesis predicts that wages will accelerate not steadily, but quickly once the tipping point is reached. While the data show some relationship between wages and the unemployment gap, the results show little evidence of an acceleration in wage growth as the economy approaches full employment. This suggests there is no pent-up wage deflation.... We believe the labor market still has considerable slack... includ[ing] workers unemployed longer than six months, those who left the workforce but will return once job opportunities appear, and part-timers who would prefer to work full time.... Because the unemployment rate is no longer an accurate measure of labor force, assumptions about the unemployment gap can produce incorrect expectations of when wages will accelerate..."</p></li>

As can be seen, women accounted for the entire rise in voluntary part-time employment, with an increase of 3.2 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. By contrast, voluntary part-time employment for men actually fell slightly. Furthermore, it is younger workers, ages 16-35, who account for the bulk of the increase. The number of people in this age group voluntarily working part-time rose by 5.0 percent. By comparison it dropped by 5.2 percent for workers between the ages of 45-55. There were small rises of less than 1.0 percent for the other two age groups. The biggest increase in voluntary part-time is for young people with children. The percentage of employed young people with children working part-time increased 11.3 percent from 2013 to 2014. For young people with three or more children the percentage working part-time increased by 15.4 percent."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Henry Aaron, David Cutler, and Peter Orszag:</strong> <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/opinion/stop-the-anti-obamacare-shenanigans.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1&amp;referrer=">Stop the Anti-Obamacare Shenanigans:</a> "So far, opponents of the Affordable Care Act have lost every major battle to repeal or invalidate it. Some of them are now urging the courts to interpret the health reform law in a way that would guarantee its failure.... Having failed to undo the individual mandate to buy health insurance, opponents now claim that, under the law, subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans to buy insurance may be paid only in those states--currently 14--that have set up their own online insurance exchanges. This would torpedo a central goal of the law: the expansion of coverage. At first, those of us who support Obamacare thought these claims were a joke. On July 22, the federal appellate court in Richmond, Va., rejected one such claim, but the same day, astonishingly, the federal appellate court for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled, 2 to 1, in favor of the plaintiff in a similar case, Halbig v. Burwell.... Now the opponents of Obamacare are asking the Supreme Court to immediately hear an appeal of the Richmond decision.... The law specifically instructed the secretary of health and human services to create and manage the exchanges for states that chose that option. And when the law was passed, everyone involved in the law’s passage understood that this directive vested federal exchanges with the same mission and authority as state-mandated exchanges.... Whatever one thinks of the Affordable Care Act, it is absurd to argue that its drafters intended to make insurance unaffordable."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ricardo Hausmann:</strong> <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ricardo-hausmann-asks-why-growth-rates-are-converging-among-some-countries-and-diverging-among-others">Why Are Growth Rates Converging Among Some  and Diverging Among Others?:</a> "When Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations in 1776, per capita income in the world’s richest country--probably the Netherlands--was about four times that of the poorest countries. Two centuries later, the Netherlands was 40 times richer than China, 24 times richer than India, and ten times richer than Thailand. But, over the past three decades, the trend reversed. Now, the Netherlands is only 11 times richer than India and barely four times richer than China and Thailand.... Yet some countries are still diverging. While the Netherlands was 5.8, 7.7, and 15 times richer than Nicaragua, Côte D’Ivoire, and Kenya, respectively, in 1980, by 2012 it was 10.5, 21.1, and 24.4.... The economic expansion of the last two centuries has been based on an explosion of knowledge about what can be made, and how. An apt metaphor is a game of Scrabble.... Countries with few 'letters' lack incentives to accumulate more letters, because they cannot do much with any additional one: you would not want a TV remote control if you didn’t have a TV, and you would not want a TV broadcasting company if your potential customers lacked electricity. This trap becomes deeper the longer the alphabet and the longer the words..."</p></li>

Not surprised that it exists, just surprise at the intensity of the issue in certain segments of the population. I'll switch back and forth between undocumented and documented immigrants a bit here probably, but what the hell could possibly motivate people to picket and scream at a bus full of refugee kids? On the flip side, here in the urban hellhole nobody seems to care. My fair city is hardly a shining example of racial harmony, but anti-immigrant sentiment appears to be incredibly muted. Of course it exists, it just doesn't seem to exist with any intensity in the city."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kessler:</strong> <a href="http://www.kesslercompanies.com/content/dont-be-fooled-recent-hawkish-fed-commentary">Don't Be Fooled by Recent Hawkish Fed Commentary:</a> "As we go into next week’s Fed meeting, the market has become consumed with the idea that the Fed funds rate may be raised earlier than the market expects.... A San Francisco Federal Reserve paper has pointed out that the Fed’s own expectations of when they will raise rates is on-average sooner than what the market... some Fed members have suggested it is time to remove a piece of language in the Fed statement promising a ‘considerable time' between the end of QE3 and the first rate rise.... The Fed’s own expectation of rate rises comes from a survey of the 16 FOMC participants.... Doing this math suggests that the Fed expects the Fed funds rate to be 1.20% by the end of 2015 but, the Fed Funds futures market is priced such that the Fed Funds rate will be 0.77% at the end of 2015, a difference of nearly two 0.25% rate hikes (0.43%). This is the crux of the SF Fed paper.... The markets are not simply unaware... the markets are... more dovish... because... Plosser... Lacker... and... Fisher... have wanted to raise rates with any excuse tracing back to 2008.... These three (and a few others), are afraid of something they have no evidence of (runaway inflation around any corner), and are too insulated from main street.... If the highest three votes in the Fed expectations survey are removed, the average Fed expectations align... with... the market.... The housing market has clearly rolled over, consumer spending hasn't shown life, and the all-important wage growth is lackluster. The mostly academic Fed is too smart to use the excuse of the ‘air’ of recovery to make a hawkish move. There is simply no reason for it.</p></li>

<p><strong>Hyman Minsky:</strong> <a href="http://larspsyll.wordpress.com/2014/09/06/minsky-on-the-is-lm-obfuscation/">Minsky on the IS-LM obfuscation:</a> "The glib assumption made by Professor Hicks...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...in his exposition of Keynes’s contribution that there is a simple, negatively sloped function, reflecting the productivity of increments to the stock of capital, that relates investment to the interest rate is a caricature of Keynes’s theory of investment... which relates the pace of investment not only to prospective yields but also to ongoing financial behavior.... The conclusion to our argument is that the missing step in the standard Keynesian theory was the explicit consideration of capitalist finance within a cyclical and speculative context... then the full power of the revolutionary insights and the alternative frame of analysis that Keynes developed becomes evident.... The greatness of The <em>General Theory</em> was that Keynes visualized [the imperfections of the monetary-financial system] as systematic rather than accidental or perhaps incidental attributes of capitalism.... Only a theory that was explicitly cyclical and overtly financial was capable of being useful... <a href="http://equitablegrowth.ms.techprogress.org/?p=6436"><strong>READ MOAR</strong></a></p>

				<p><strong>Henry Aaron, David Cutler, and Peter Orszag:</strong> <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/opinion/stop-the-anti-obamacare-shenanigans.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1&amp;referrer=">Stop the Anti-Obamacare Shenanigans:</a> "So far, opponents of the Affordable Care Act...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...have lost every major battle to repeal or invalidate it. Some of them are now urging the courts to interpret the health reform law in a way that would guarantee its failure.... Having failed to undo the individual mandate to buy health insurance, opponents now claim that, under the law, subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans to buy insurance may be paid only in those states--currently 14--that have set up their own online insurance exchanges. This would torpedo a central goal of the law: the expansion of coverage. At first, those of us who support Obamacare thought these claims were a joke. On July 22, the federal appellate court in Richmond, Va., rejected one such claim, but the same day, astonishingly, the federal appellate court for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled, 2 to 1, in favor of the plaintiff in a similar case, Halbig v. Burwell.... Now the opponents of Obamacare are asking the Supreme Court to immediately hear an appeal of the Richmond decision.... The law specifically instructed the secretary of health and human services to create and manage the exchanges for states that chose that option. And when the law was passed, everyone involved in the law’s passage understood that this directive vested federal exchanges with the same mission and authority as state-mandated exchanges.... Whatever one thinks of the Affordable Care Act, it is absurd to argue that its drafters intended to make insurance unaffordable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must say that Republican governors and state-level legislators are already furious at John Roberts for how he forced them to alienate either their activist Tea Party base or their fund-raising medical base over Medicaid expansion. They would be even more furious if Roberts forced them to go through the same thing again--this time not over Medicaid expansion but over state exchange establishment.</p>

<p><strong>Helene Jorgensen and Dean Baker:</strong> <a href="http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/aca-pt-2014-09.pdf">The Affordable Care Act: A Family Friendly Policy:</a> "Table 3 gives a breakdown of the distribution of part-time employment by age, gender, and whether or not the household has children. As can be seen, women accounted for the entire rise in voluntary part-time employment, with an increase of 3.2 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. By contrast, voluntary part-time employment for men actually fell slightly.
Furthermore, it is younger workers, ages 16-35, who account for the bulk of the increase. The number of people in this age group voluntarily working part-time rose by 5.0 percent. By comparison it dropped by 5.2 percent for workers between the ages of 45-55. There were small rises of less than 1.0 percent for the other two age groups. The biggest increase in voluntary part-time is for young people with children. The percentage of employed young people with children working part-time increased 11.3 percent from 2013 to 2014. For young people with three or more children the percentage working part-time increased by 15.4 percent."</p>

				<h3><a href="http://equitablegrowth.ms.techprogress.org/?p=6415"><strong>Over at Equitable Growth:</strong></a> "Trapped in the 'Dark Corners'"?: Thoughts on Olivier Blanchard's "Where Danger Lurks"</h3>

<p>Olivier Blanchard, inveighing against "ergodicity" and "linearity" as assumptions, sounds like some post-Keynesian from the 1980s. They were right then. He is right now:</p>

<p><strong>Olivier Blanchard:</strong> <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2014/09/blanchard.htm">Where Danger Lurks:</a> "One has to go back to the so-called rational expectations revolution...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...What was new was the development of techniques to solve models under the assumption that people and firms did the best they could in assessing the future. (A glimpse into why this was technically hard: current decisions by people and firms depend on their whole expected future. But their whole expected future itself depends in part on current decisions.) These techniques... made sense only... [if] economic fluctuations were regular enough so that, by looking at the past, people and firms (and the econometricians)... could understand their nature and form expectations... and simple enough so that small shocks had small effects.... Thinking about macroeconomics was largely shaped by those assumptions....</p>

				<p>How different are reserve-currency issuing sovereigns with exorbitant privilege?</p>

<p>With the exception of the Great Contraction of 1929-1933, ever since 1914 with the beginning of World War I--no, ever since 1896 and the full-scale exploitation of the gold mines of the Witwatersrand--the rate of interest on the world's fundamental monetary security, the bonds of the sovereign or four whose assets serve as global reserves, has invariably been less than the growth rate of the global economy's potential output, and has often in real terms been less than zero. The deflation of 1929 to 1933 will never come again. </p>

				<p>A little more evidence to move you slightly, slightly toward the position that the unemployment rate is exaggerating the extent to which the economy has moved toward full employment...</p>

<p><strong>Ryan Sweet and Adam Ozimek:</strong> <a href="https://www.economy.com/dismal/article_free.asp?cid=250080&amp;tid=5FCB4BBF-D759-422D-BD25-BFF7D505D457">U.S. Employment Outlook: Solving the Wage Puzzle:</a> "The U.S. labor market has tightened...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...but wage growth remains mediocre at best. This appears counterintuitive: All else equal, falling rates of unemployment should prompt faster wage growth. Several potential explanations have been offered.... One is that the unemployment rate could be sending a false signal about the amount of slack in the job market. Another... blames pent-up wage deflation... firms could not cut nominal wages by as much as they wanted during the recession, and are thus reluctant to raise wages now.... Because the economies of U.S. states experienced different rates of recession and recovery, they offer a laboratory in which to test the pent-up wage deflation hypothesis.... </p>
  
  <p>In six states the unemployment rates are below NAIRU, while in four states it is 1.5 percentage points above full employment.... The pent-up wage deflation hypothesis predicts that wages will accelerate not steadily, but quickly once the tipping point is reached. While the data show some relationship between wages and the unemployment gap, the results show little evidence of an acceleration in wage growth as the economy approaches full employment. This suggests there is no pent-up wage deflation.... We believe the labor market still has considerable slack... includ[ing] workers unemployed longer than six months, those who left the workforce but will return once job opportunities appear, and part-timers who would prefer to work full time.... Because the unemployment rate is no longer an accurate measure of labor force, assumptions about the unemployment gap can produce incorrect expectations of when wages will accelerate...</p>

And I keep failing to make my objections clear in a way that convinces him I have a point rather than simply being a Crazy-Old-Keynesian-Yelling-at-Clouds. Let me try it again:</p>

<p>The way Nick sees it, The key is money demand and money supply (at full employment). When money demand is greater than money supply, people try to cut their spending hello their income in order to build up cash balances. The problem, of course, is that one person spending is another person's income. So everyone's income falls until everyone's income is so low that people in aggregate no longer wish to build up their cash balances right now. And there the economy sits, depressed, until something happens to balance money demand and money supply (at full employment). [<strong>READ MOAR:</strong>]</p>

				<p>I put this aside at the time because the CEA's analysis seemed to me to be likely to be wrong in two areas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Their short-run Keynesian multipliers looked low to me for large states, and for states surrounded by other non-expanding states.</p></li>
<li><p>In a long-run model in which we assume "full" or "normal" employment, increased federal government spending does not add to national GDP, but where the federal government dollars are spent redistributes economic activity around the country: Texas, Kansas, Missouri, Virginia, Louisiana, and company lose; and California, Oregon, Colorado, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts gain; to the tune of a Moretti-style regional multiplier by which $1 of extra federal spending acts as do $1 of regional exports and so attract enough labor, capital, and enterprise to boost state-level economic product by $1.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But I never wrote up my long comment on the CEA's report, and so it is time to declare commenting bankruptcy on this one...</p>

<h2>Macroeconomic Policy for a Stronger Recovery</h2>

<p><strong>J. Bradford DeLong <br />
Professor of Economics, U.C. Berkeley <br />
Research Associate, NBER</strong></p>

<p><em>September 30, 2009</em></p>

<p><strong>A Little Background</strong></p>

<p>About a year and a half ago&mdash;in the days after the forced merger of Bear Stearns into J.P. MorganChase, say&mdash;there was a near consensus of economists that an additional dose of expansionary fiscal policy was unlikely to be necessary.  The Congress had passed a first round of tax cut-based stimulus, the impact of which in the summer of 2008 is clearly visible in disposable personal income and perhaps visible in the tracks of estimated monthly real GDP. The near-consensus belief back then, however, was that that was the only expansionary discretionary fiscal policy move that was appropriate. <a href="http://equitablegrowth.ms.techprogress.org/?p=6401"><strong>READ MOAR</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...real domestic demand in the eurozone was 5 per cent lower than in the first quarter of 2008. The eurozone’s unemployment rate has risen by just under 5 percentage points since 2008. In the year to July 2014, consumer price inflation in the eurozone was 0.4 per cent.... The eurozone is in a depression; lack of demand has played a crucial role; and the European Central Bank has failed to deliver on its own price-stability target. This is not just sad. It is dangerous. It is folly to assume continued stability if economic performance does not improve. A necessary, though not sufficient, condition for grappling with these challenges is understanding them.... Mario Draghi... the one senior eurozone policy maker who shows a grasp of the issues, made a vital contribution at this year’s Jackson Hole symposium.... The capacity of the peoples of member states to tolerate high unemployment and deep slumps has been impressive. But it cannot be unlimited. If that is what the powers that be continue to advocate, the result will probably be a populist reaction.... Who is sure Marine Le Pen, leader of the far right National Front party, will not be the next president of France? Who would follow Matteo Renzi, Italy’s prime minister, if he failed? Yes, these member states need to act. But they surely need support. Mr Draghi has shown the way. The eurozone must follow.</p>

<p>When r > n+g, the case for budget surpluses and lowering the debt is strong. We believe that private investments are even more productive to society than the market rate of return on private capital formation tells us. We believe that there are private knowledge and other spillovers from private capital formation. We believe that the quasi-rents from past investments are shared among all those with market power who participate in production. Thus when the government borrows and spends, it crowds out private investments that are very profitable to society as a whole. This point is strengthened by the danger of a runaway government financial crisis should a default premium begin to incorporate itself into government borrowing rates. This point is limited only by intergenerational equity considerations: that if we think the future will be richer than the present, committing funds now to private capital formation rather than to private and government consumption worsens intergenerational inequality. <a href="http://equitablegrowth.ms.techprogress.org/?p=6388"><strong>READ MOAR</strong></a></p>

				<p>From Sewell Tyng: <em>The Campaign of the Marne</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The day of September 8th had been a particularly hard one for the French. The Ninth Army heavily engaged on its left, with its centre yielding and its right almost broken, had engaged every available battalion and no further reserves remained. In vain Foch appealed to De Langle, his neighbour to the east. The Fourth Army too was fighting a desperate battle around Vitry-le-François and had no means of lending support. The 21st Army Corps (Legrand-Girarde) which Joffre had brought from Lorraine to fill the gap between the Fourth and Ninth Armies was still ten kilometres away at nightfall.... It was at this crisis that Foch is reported to have sent his celebrated dispatch to Joffre:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Hard pressed on my right. My centre is yielding. Impossible to manoeuvre. Situation excellent. I am attacking....</p>
  </blockquote>
