Primary season ended with a bang on Tuesday when 35-year-old Marine veteran Seth Moulton upset Democratic Rep. John Tierney (MA-06) in the Massachusetts primary. How did polls miss it, just as they missed Majority Leader Eric Cantor's loss? One common thread this year has been that just about every voter who has woken up undecided on election day has voted for the "change" candidate.

As Congress returns to Washington this week for the few remaining legislative days before the midterm elections, lawmakers will compare notes on what they heard and saw back home.

Democrats' assessments will be particularly enlightening, and my guess is that those reports will be about as discouraging as they can...</p>

Kansas politics have proven to be more interesting this year than at any time since perhaps 1996 when there were two open Senate seats and Bob Dole, the state’s senior Senator, was the Republican presidential nominee.

					<h4><a href="/senate">Senate</a></h4>
					<a href="/senate"><img src="/assets/public/images/senate.png" alt="Senate" /></a>
				</div>
				<p>The current Senate line-up is 53 Democrats, 45 Republicans, and two independents that caucus with Democrats.&nbsp; There are 36 Senate races on the ballot in 2014.&nbsp; To win the majority, Republicans would have to score a net gain of six seats.&nbsp; Democrats are defending 21 of these seats, including six in states that GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney won easily in 2012, and two more that are in swing states.&nbsp; By contrast, Republicans will defend 15 seats, only one of which is in a state that President Obama carried in 2012.&nbsp; Republicans have also successfully expanded the playing field of vulnerable Democratic-held seats, increasing their chances of winning the majority.&nbsp; Republicans are on track to pick up between four and six seats; it is more likely than not that the number will be at the higher end of – and may exceed – that range. </p>

					<li>
				<div class="photo">
					<h4><a href="/house">House</a></h4>
					<a href="/house"><img src="/assets/public/images/house.png" alt="House" /></a>
				</div>
				<p>The current House breakdown is 234 Republicans, 199 Democrats, and two Democratic vacancies. Democrats need a net gain of 17 seats to reach a majority in 2014. Because the House is well sorted-out, large shifts or a change in partisan control of the House are unlikely. In large part because of President Obama's standing and the GOP's midterm turnout advantages, we would estimate a Republican gain of between two and 12 House seats if the election were held today.</p>

					<li>
				<div class="photo">
					<h4><a href="/governor">Governors</a></h4>
					<a href="/governor"><img src="/assets/public/images/governor.png" alt="Governors" /></a>
				</div>
				<p><p>The current line up of the nation’s Governors is 29 Republicans and 21 Democrats. There are 36 contests in 2014.  Of these 36 races, 22 are held by Republicans and 14 by Democrats.  Republicans have far more exposure to losses.  Of the GOP’s 22 seats, President Obama easily carried seven of these states in 2012, while another three seats are in swing states.  Only one of Democrats’ 14 seats is in a state that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney carried.  While a favorable political landscape should help Republicans in the Senate and the House, it won’t be as helpful in gubernatorial contests.  As such, Democrats are likely to gain between two and four seats.</p></p>
