      <description><![CDATA[A decade ago, it was widely agreed that rapidly rising health care costs were a threat to America's economic future. Pundits, business leaders, and government officials lined up to warn that skyrocketing health care costs were seriously damaging the United States' economy and jeopardizing its long-term fiscal health.  <br />
<br />
The then-head of the Business Roundtable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061001210046/http:/www.businessroundtable.org/newsroom/document.aspx?qs=5916BF807822B0F1AD0438122FB51711FCF50C8" target="_hplink">warned</a> "There's no question that rising health care costs are one of the biggest threats to families, businesses and U.S. competitiveness," and the then-CEO of General Motors <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15828-2005Feb10.html" target="_hplink">said</a> "Failing to address the health care crisis would be the worst kind of procrastination, the kind that places our children and our grandchildren at risk and threatens the health and global competitiveness of our nation's economy."<br />
<br />
A decade later, the United States is in the midst of a historic slowdown in health care cost growth that is helping to increase workers' take-home pay, cutting businesses' costs, and forcing budget analysts to recalibrate earlier, more pessimistic projections. This slowdown in health care cost growth ranks as one of the most important recent developments in our economy, yet it has received comparatively little attention outside of health policy circles, and the broader media coverage has often missed the overwhelmingly clear positive story, focusing instead on the occasional, isolated contrary data points.<br />
Consider:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>The average premium for family coverage grew by just 3.0 percent (or 1.2 percent adjusted for inflation) in 2014, tying 2010 for the slowest rate on record, according to <a href="http://kff.org/private-insurance/report/2014-employer-health-benefits-survey/" target="_hplink">survey results</a> released today by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust. This survey has been conducted annually since 1999 and just more than a decade ago was frequently registering double-digit premium increases.</li></ul><br />
	<br />
<ul><li>From 2010 through 2013, Medicare spending fell in real per capita terms. Data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) show that that trend has continued through the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45694" target="_hplink">first eleven months</a> of fiscal year 2014, with spending per beneficiary falling in nominal terms relative to the same period in the last fiscal year.</li></ul><br />
<br />
<ul><li>Across 16 large markets, the premium for the second-lowest-cost silver plan on the Affordable Care Act's Health Insurance Marketplaces will fall by 0.8 percent on average from 2014 to 2015, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation <a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/press-release/premiums-set-to-decline-slightly-for-benchmark-aca-marketplace-insurance-plans-in-2015/" target="_hplink">report</a> released last week.  And the 2014 premiums themselves were <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/45231-ACA_Estimates.pdf" target="_hplink">15 percent below</a> the original CBO projections.  </li></ul><br />
<br />
<ul><li>Health care prices are up just 1.6 percent on a year-over-year basis, slightly below the 1.8 percent rate recorded since early 2010, itself the slowest rate for such a period in almost 50 years.</li></ul><br />
<br />
<ul><li>The three slowest years of growth in real per capital total national health expenditures on record were 2011, 2012 and 2013, according to official estimates <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/03/new-report-shows-slow-health-care-spending-growth-continued-2013-while-near-term-tre" target="_hplink">released last week</a> going back to 1960. Real per capita health expenditures grew by an average annual rate of 1.1 percent in these years, less than one-third of the 3.4 percent annual rate from 2000 to 2010. </li></ul><br />
 <br />
<a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-10-CEA_HealthCosts_91014_Figure1.jpg"><img alt="2014-09-10-CEA_HealthCosts_91014_Figure1.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-10-CEA_HealthCosts_91014_Figure1-thumb.jpg" width="570" height="413" /></a><br />
<br />
While growth in aggregate health care spending will temporarily pick up over the next few years as <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1406753" target="_hplink">millions of Americans gain coverage</a> and can finally get the care they need, the data catalogued above show that the underlying trends in health care prices, premiums, and per-enrollee costs that gave rise to these record-breaking years are continuing.<br />
<br />
The economic implications of the health care cost slowdown are immense. Take today's news on employer premiums. If instead of the slow employer premium growth we have seen since 2010, premium growth had continued at the rate witnessed over the prior decade, then average premium for employer coverage would be $1,800 higher in 2014. These savings make it easier for employers to add jobs today and will <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/achandr/JLE_LaborMktEffectsRisingHealthInsurancePremiums_2006.pdf" target="_hplink">ultimately translate</a> to bigger paychecks for workers. <br />
<br />
Recent trends have also sharply improved our nation's fiscal outlook. Since August 2010, CBO has reduced its projection of Medicare and Medicaid spending in 2020 by $188 billion, due largely to recent health care cost trends. These savings are on top of the direct effects of the Affordable Care Act, which the agency <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43471" target="_hplink">previously estimated</a> would shave more than $100 billion from deficits over ten years and reduce deficits by an average of 0.5 percent of GDP per year over the following ten years. These savings total $1.7 trillion over the law's first two decades.<br />
<br />
Exactly what caused the slowdown in health care costs and whether the slowdown will persist is the subject of a vigorous ongoing debate among academics and other observers. The deep recession, which squeezed families' and businesses' budgets and caused many to lose employer coverage, almost certainly played some role. As the economy recovers, any effects of the recession in reducing health care cost growth will continue to recede.<br />
<br />
But, as the Council of Economic Advisers <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/erp_2014_chapter_4.pdf" target="_hplink">discussed in detail</a> in this year's Economic Report of the President, the recession is far from the whole story. The slowdown has been dramatic even in Medicare, where beneficiaries are largely insulated from changes in the labor market, not just private insurance. Moreover, the latest slow growth in employer premiums coincided with a year in which the economy was five years past the end of the recession and added 2.4 million jobs, cutting the unemployment rate by 1.2 percentage points.<br />
 <br />
<a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-10-CEA_HealthCosts_91014_Figure2.jpg"><img alt="2014-09-10-CEA_HealthCosts_91014_Figure2.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-10-CEA_HealthCosts_91014_Figure2-thumb.jpg" width="570" height="414" /></a><br />
<br />
The full list of non-recession "structural" factors driving the slowdown is not yet known, and some of them pre-dated both the Great Recession and the Affordable Care Act. But since 2010, the slowdown has not just continued, it has deepened, thanks, in part, to some key policy changes made in the Affordable Care Act:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>The law reduced excessive payments to medical providers and insurers in Medicare, reforms that are currently saving the Federal government <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43471" target="_hplink">billions of dollars</a> each year.</li></ul><br />
	<br />
<ul><li>The law included many measures that are shifting Medicare toward rewarding efficient, high-quality care rather than simply paying more for a higher quantity of services. For example, financial incentives to hospitals to reduce "readmissions"--instances in which a patient is discharged from the hospital, but returns soon thereafter--have already shown promising results. The readmission rate in Medicare has fallen precipitously since the program's rules were finalized, a decline that corresponds to <a href="http://innovation.cms.gov/Files/reports/patient-safety-results.pdf" target="_hplink">150,000 avoided readmissions</a> in 2012 and 2013.</li></ul><br />
<br />
<ul><li>Similarly, the law created Accountable Care Organizations, a new health care payment model in Medicare in which providers share the savings generated when they provide high-quality care, but do so more efficiently. Thousands of Medicare providers have now joined together in 360 such organizations. Research on a <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/8/1885.short" target="_hplink">similar model</a> used by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts found that this model reduced costs and improved quality, and the <a href="http://innovation.cms.gov/Files/reports/PioneerACOEvalReport1.pdf" target="_hplink">first outside evaluation</a> of one of the Federal government's Accountable Care Organization programs found promising results in the program's first year. </li></ul><br />
<br />
A <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w19503" target="_hplink">growing</a> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6773.12101/abstract" target="_hplink">research</a> <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/32/5/935.full" target="_hplink">literature</a> suggests that the benefits of these reforms will not be limited to Medicare.  Rather, this research finds that changes in the level and structure of Medicare payments are frequently adopted, at least in part, by private insurers as well, generating savings throughout the health care system.  <br />
<br />
Looking ahead, it is impossible to know with certainty what the future will bring for health care costs, which have historically been difficult to predict. But it is striking to note that if even as little as one-third of the recent slowdown persists, then, by 2023, national health expenditures would be $1,200 per person lower than if cost growth returned to the prior trend. Savings of that magnitude, on top of the dramatic savings that have already been achieved, would be transformative for families, businesses, the Federal budget, and our economy. In the years ahead, the President will remain focused on creating a health care system that delivers efficient, high-quality care in order to make these savings a reality. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Tonight President Obama will address the American public and explain his decision to expand the ongoing Middle East war with more US bombings in Iraq and Syria. The decision to expand the US military campaign comes amidst high public emotions stirred by two gruesome beheadings.  Yet Obama is leading us into a prolonged trap; the fight against ISIS (the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIL) is a fight for the region itself.<br />
<br />
It is also a fight that should be waged more through politics and economic development than bombs.  The United Nations can and should provide the framework for an effective response, not the US.  Yet again, as with George W. Bush, Obama will needlessly set the US up as the leader of a crusade against Islam.  <br />
<br />
We should understand from the start (as painful as it is true) that the US had a major hand in creating the new ISIS monster.  The US funded the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan in the 1980s, which then morphed into al-Qaeda.  Then the US destabilized Iraq from 1990 onward and Syria from the mid-2000s, in effect giving al-Qaeda and its affiliates a new stronghold. (As Assad moved closer to Iran, the US and Saudi Arabia took up the effort to topple him.)  ISIS broke away from al-Qaeda, and then captured the weaponry that the US had supplied to the Iraqi army.  Now, President Obama is getting us still deeper into this never-ending battle with monsters stoked by our own ill-advised policies.   <br />
<br />
The regional powers know these actors all too well, and have funded them along the way, in particular Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  Some of ISIS leaders are reportedly former military men of Saddam Hussein, who in turn was funded by America in the earlier era before the US declared him to be the new enemy.  If the regional powers want to end ISIS, they can do it.  Of course they'd rather have the hated US do it, with the US thereby bearing the anti-Islamic sentiment in their place.   The regional powers should take the lead in confronting ISIS, not the US.  And when they do so, they should do so under a UN mandate. This would be possible to achieve since Russia and China, like the US, France, and Britain, have no interest in another renegade fundamentalist paramilitary.<br />
<br />
Moreover, in this case the enemy of our enemy is actually a thug, not a friend.  We have been working around the clock with the Saudis and others to provide logistics support, finances, and arms to the Free Syrian Army.  Though the official line in DC is that Obama has refused to engage in Syria, in fact we've already spent a small fortune supplying and training the FSA and have facilitated support for the FSA from regional neighbors like Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  <br />
<br />
Yet the FSA's goals and methods are certainly not the same as America's, as shown by their own record of beheadings and other atrocities. Before signing up for the FSA, have a look at what has resulted in this so-called Syrian civil war.  There are now around 200,000 dead Syrians.  Yes, Assad would have crushed the opposition with a few hundred dead if it had not been for us.  Now vast numbers are dead; the country is in ruins; 5 million are refugees; and Assad is once again nearly our partner as a foe of ISIS. <br />
<br />
So why is Obama leading us further down this failed path?  The US fights these failed wars mainly because of domestic politics.  Here the precedent of Vietnam is as deeply instructive as it is widely forgotten (or denied).  The US wasted two decades and many billions of dollars, killed more than a million Vietnamese, and left over 55,000 Americans dead in a futile and ultimately lost war.  Why?  On the public level, the fight was supposedly about the communist threat, regional dominoes, and communist world domination.  The Vietcong were the ISIS of the day. Yet the real reason for two decades of futile war, as revealed devastatingly in the Pentagon Papers, was US domestic politics.  Each US President knew the war they were waging was unwinnable, but they fought it to avoid the embarrassment of looking "soft on communism" before the next US election.  <br />
<br />
This time, the timeline against ISIS will be at least through 2016.  We can't win this war any more that we could win the Vietnam War, but Obama dare not "lose" the war on terror before the next election.  Therefore we continue the same hopeless policies of the past dozen years, double down, and carry them through 2016. <br />
<br />
These wars are therefore as open-ended as they are futile.  How, then, did the Vietnam War actually end?  Simple.  Richard Nixon resigned the Presidency in 1974, and Ford let the final defeat occur a year after (and then was himself defeated in 1976).  <br />
<br />
If the US had a real strategy for national success, we would let the Middle East face and resolve its own crises, and demand a UN framework for action.  We would team up not with NATO, but with the UN Security Council, and put others (for once!) into the lead.  We would actually mobilize to solve the real problems facing the region: poverty, hunger, drought, and unemployment.  Those are the crises that at the end of the day cause men and boys to fling their lives into useless and suicidal slaughter. If just once in our times US politicians had the bravery to build coalitions to improve the lives of the people through development rather than through bombs, the US public would be amazed to see how much agreement and goodwill could quickly generate.  Instead we head to war. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[National Security Council<br />
The White House<br />
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue<br />
Washington, DC  20500<br />
                                                            September 10, 2014<br />
<br />
To the distinguished staff at the National Security Council,<br />
<br />
As President Barack Obama and the National Security Council team have stated unequivocally over the past week, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is one of the most dangerous national security threats that the United States faces in the world today.  The organization's penchant for absolute and undiscriminating brutality against civilians -- men, women and children alike -- is a shock to the conscience of the world in the 21st Century.  Only the United States, with its military capability, dedicated intelligence professionals, diplomatic prowess, and leadership qualities, can best degrade and ultimately defeat the threat that ISIL poses.<br />
<br />
To this end, I applaud the NSC's dedication over the past week in reaching out to our friends, allies, and partners in the Arab world in order ensure that all nations with a stake in the region's stability are participating in lockstep with the United States.  Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq all have an ability to contribute the manpower, intelligence capability, and funding that will be required to resist the territorial gains that ISIL has made over the past two months.  The goal, as the president has said, is to defeat the organization's ability to inflict harm on innocents and its capacity to execute terrorist attacks on American citizens and American interests.  The establishment of a core group of countries willing to assist the United States in this objective, including America's principle European allies Great Britain, France, and Germany, will send a powerful message to ISIL's leadership and foot-soldiers that the entire world -- not just the U.S. -- views its activity as abhorrent and incompatible with even the most basic of human rights.  <br />
<br />
There has been a rash of commentary from conservative magazines, newspapers, editorial boards, and Republicans on Capitol Hill questioning whether the president and his administration have a clear-cut plan for degrading and defeating ISIL.  Speaker Boehner, Minority Leader McConnell, and key Republican lawmakers on the Senate and House foreign relations and armed services committees have consistently argued that the White House is reacting to the ISIL scourge too slowly and is still finalizing a strategy before presenting it to the Congress and the American people.  Yet, just as the president exhibited caution and patience during the Afghanistan policy war review in the fall of 2009, it is equally important that President Obama and his national security team think through all of the alternatives -- including what the long-term objective is, what action will be needed to accomplish it, how long this action will take, and what the consequences or repercussions may be.  <br />
<br />
Appealing to our Arab allies in the region is critical if we are to have any success in checking ISIL's expansion and eventually shrinking its area of operations.  U.S. air strikes on ISIL bases and facilities in Iraq and Syria will certainly help in the short-term, as has been demonstrated near Erbil, Sinjar mountain, and the Mosul Dam.  But in order to fully capitalize on the technological capabilities that the U.S. possesses, we must partner with forces on the ground that are willing to fight back against ISIL militants.  <br />
<br />
I therefore encourage the administration to quickly expedite the $500 million in assistance to the moderate Syrian opposition as soon as Congress approves the package.  Just as the Department of Defense has partnered with the Iraqi Government and the Kurdish peshmerga to great affect so far, the U.S. must follow the same path in Syria.  Allying with Bashar al-Assad's regime, even indirectly, should not be an option.  Therefore, if Congress delays action on the your proposed $500 million spending package for a large-scale train and equip mission for the moderate elements of the Syrian opposition, the White House should sincerely think about expanding what has thus far been a small-sized covert mission in Jordan.  Without strengthening the moderate Syrians on the ground and building their capacity to take advantage of U.S. air strikes, clearing Syria from ISIL will be virtually impossible.  <br />
<br />
As an American citizen who one day hopes to become a public servant and who frequently monitors our nation's foreign policy, I continue to wish you and your colleagues in the State Department, Pentagon, and intelligence community the best of luck.  America's security depends on the efforts that you make in the weeks ahead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With respect,<br />
Daniel R. DePetris ]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Individual-Candidate Super PACs Threaten to Wipe Out Candidate Contribution Limits]]></title>

      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fred-wertheimer/individual-candidate-super-pacs_b_5791620.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&amp;ir=Politics</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2014 11:59:05 -0400</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[In 1974, Congress enacted limits on contributions to candidates to prevent corruption. <br />
<br />
Today, these contribution limits are in danger of being wiped out by individual-candidate Super PACs. <br />
<br />
The Supreme Court's <em>Citizens United</em> decision in 2010 unleashed the world of Super PACs into our elections. Along with them, came individual-candidate Super PACs. <br />
<br />
Super PACs raise unlimited contributions from wealthy individuals, corporations and other special interests. The PACs are required to spend the funds independently from candidate campaigns.  <br />
<br />
If they do not, the expenditures are treated by campaign finance laws as in-kind contributions to the candidate being supported and are subject to the $5,000 per year limit on PAC contributions to candidates.<br />
<br />
Individual-candidate Super PACS differ from other Super PACs in two important ways: they support only one candidate and they are generally run by close political or personal associates or family members of the candidate. <br />
<br />
While individual-candidate Super PACs claim to be independent from the candidate they support, in reality they are closely tied to the candidate and function as an operating arm of the candidate's campaign. <br />
<br />
The real purpose of an individual-candidate Super PAC is to circumvent candidate contribution limits. Wealthy donors, corporations and other contributors use these Super PACs as vehicles to make unlimited contributions to directly support the candidate backed by the Super PAC.<br />
<br />
Individual-candidate Super PACs first surfaced in the 2012 presidential campaign. Almost every presidential candidate, including President Obama and Republican nominee Romney, had a Super PAC focused only on their candidacy.<br />
<br />
For example, two White House officials left the Obama Administration and shortly thereafter created Priorities USA Action to support the Obama reelection campaign. The Super PAC spent more than $65 million in unlimited contributions in the 2012 presidential campaign to support President Obama. <br />
<br />
Three former top officials of the Romney 2008 presidential campaign created Restore Our Future to support the 2012 Romney presidential campaign. This individual-candidate Super PAC spent $142 million in unlimited contributions to support Romney - the most spent by any super PAC in the 2012 elections.<br />
<br />
Casino executive Sheldon Adelson and his wife, who gave $30 million to Restore Our Future, and broadcast executive Fred Eychaner, who gave $4.5 million to Priorities USA Action, knew they were making these multi-million dollar contributions to directly support Romney and Obama respectively. The presidential candidates, of course, knew this as well. <br />
<br />
These same donors could only give $5,000 directly to the candidate's campaign committee. Thus, by giving multi-million dollar contributions to the Super PAC supporting only their favored candidate, the donors and the presidential candidates were able to bypass and eviscerate the candidate contribution limit.<br />
<br />
The number of individual-candidate Super PACs has exploded in the 2014 congressional elections, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?chrt=V&type=C" target="_hplink">with 71 such Super PACs currently in existence</a>, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). These include individual-candidate Super PACs financed by the candidates' relatives, or run by the candidate's former political aides and close associates, or financed by single donors.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/the-line-at-the-super-pac-trough.html?_r=0" target="_hplink">A <em>New York Times</em> editorial (February 16, 2014)</a> concluded, "This election year will be the moment when individual candidate super PACs -- a form of legalized bribery -- become a truly toxic force in American politics."<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-shadow-of-dark-money-haunts-the-midterms/2014/09/02/4db0156e-2fbe-11e4-994d-202962a9150c_story.html" target="_hplink">A <em>Washington Post</em> editorial (September 3, 2014)</a> noted that the "cozy relations between a candidate and super PAC patrons are now commonplace, both in House and Senate races. When put behind a single candidate, these super PACs can make a difference in a tight race and all but destroy the idea of limits on campaign donations."<br />
<br />
Individual-candidate Super PACs have raised more than $35 million in unlimited contributions for congressional races in this election cycle, to date, according to CRP. Many millions more will be raised and spent in the upcoming two months.<br />
<br />
The Roberts majority on the Supreme Court has made it increasingly difficult to prevent the corruption of federal officeholders and government decisions. Individual-candidate Super PACs, however, are a vehicle for corruption that can be shut down, even under the Court's decisions.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.democracy21.org/ppf-notes/press-releases-ppf-notes/a-summary-of-h-r-6448-the-empowering-citizens-act-2/" target="_hplink">The Empowering Citizens Act (H.R.270)</a>, the comprehensive reform bill introduced in the House by Representatives David Price and Chris Van Hollen, would accomplish this goal.<br />
<br />
The Price-Van Hollen Bill would end individual-candidate Super PACs by defining coordination between a candidate and outside spending group to include the indicia that closely tie an individual-candidate Super PAC to the candidate being supported. <br />
<br />
These indicia include the roles played by the candidate's former political operatives or close associates in managing these PACs, the involvement of family members in financing or managing the PACs and the role played by the candidate and his agents in creating, managing or raising money for the PACs.    <br />
<br />
The <em>Post</em> editorial (September 3, 2014) stated,  "Two years ago, we suggested these super PACs could be put out of their misery by legislation sponsored by Reps. David E. Price (D-N.C.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and it is still a good idea. There are more of these super beasts than ever."<br />
<br />
The <em>New York Times</em> editorial (February 16, 2014) stated that the Price-Van Hollen bill's Super PAC provisions represent "the best chance for ridding politics of special-interest cash and preventing another era of scandal."  <br />
<br />
Past Supreme Court decisions have held that candidates must be "totally independent," "wholly independent and "truly independent" from outside spending groups, and that outside spending must be done "without any candidate's approval (or wink or nod)." <br />
<br />
In other words, the Supreme Court has said in very strong and clear terms that there can be no coordination between a candidate and an outside group spending money to support the candidate. <br />
<br />
Since individual-candidate Super PACs are typically managed, operated or financed by close political or personal associates or family members of the candidate, they are inherently coordinated with the candidate they support. The Empowering Citizens Act incorporates these relationships into a new definition of coordination in order to prevent the blatant circumvention of the campaign finance laws by individual-candidate Super PACS.<br />
<br />
Congress can solve the insidious problem of individual-candidate Super PACs being used to wipe out candidate contribution limits. The Empowering Citizens Act will do this.<br />
<br />
Without the Empowering Citizens Act, we will return soon to a system of unlimited candidate contributions -- a system that the Supreme Court found "inherently corrupt" in 1976 when it upheld the constitutionality of contribution limits. This system remains "inherently corrupt" today. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Former Vice President Dick Cheney offered yet another critique of President Barack Obama's foreign policy on Wednesday, but beneath the heated rhetoric the leading architect of the Iraq War prescribed a strategy for countering Islamic State militants that essentially aligns with most politicians around the country.<br />
<br />
Speaking at an American Enterprise Institute event in Washington, Cheney urged the president to counter Islamic State militants in the Middle East by expanding airstrikes in Syria, training Iraq's military forces, and partnering with allies to arm moderate Syrian opposition forces fighting President Bashar al-Assad. He stopped short, however, of calling for more U.S. ground troops in the region.<br />
<br />
"A realistic strategy has to recognize that ISIS [Islamic State in Iraq and Syria] is a grave, strategic threat to the United States," he said. "The situation is dire and defeating these terrorists will require immediate, sustained, simultaneous action across multiple fronts. Phasing in our actions will not suffice. Such a strategy will only prolong the conflict and increase the casualties."<br />
<br />
When he speaks to the nation in a primetime address on Wednesday evening, Obama is expected to outline an expanded military and political effort to combat Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, including potentially launching airstrikes in Syria, according to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/10/obama-isis-syria_n_5796584.html" target="_hplink">Associated Press</a>. The speech comes amid growing concern about the threat posed by ISIS, with more Americans saying the United States is <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/isis-threat-fear-terror-attack-soars-9-11-high-nbc-n199496" target="_hplink">less safe now than at any point since 9/11</a>.<br />
<br />
The majority of Cheney's speech was dedicated to his faults with Obama's foreign policy, a topic he has returned to again and again in recent years. Obama is a "disengaged" president, the former vice president said, who has miscalculated threats to America's interests abroad.<br />
<br />
"Whether it’s outright enemies like the regimes in Iran and North Korea, or strategic rivals like Russia and China, hostile people are drawing conclusions from the choices we make. They take note of the hard things we do as the pre-eminent democracy, and of the hard things we finish," he said.<br />
<br />
"They watch what our leaders do, the enemies of America, and they listen to what our leaders say," he added. "And a few of our most single-minded enemies might well have wondered why, in recent years, President Obama was talking about the terrorists being on the run, in retreat, when precisely the opposite was happening."<br />
<br />
Cheney further urged Obama to expand the global war on terror by ramping up defense spending, including the post-9/11 "Bush-Cheney security apparatus" -- policies he noted the president once opposed.  <br />
<br />
Reacting to news that Cheney met with House Republicans on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) expressed some mockery of the former vice president for beating the drums of war in the nation he helped invade. <br />
<br />
"There are people here in Congress who are taking advice from Dick Cheney," Reid <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/10/harry-reid-dick-cheney_n_5797392.html" target="_hplink">said</a> in a Wednesday Senate floor speech. "I think they better be very careful with the advice that they take from Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney is more responsible than anyone else for the worst foreign policy decision in the history of the country -- the invasion of Iraq." ]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[No to Fast-Tracking Harmful Trade Pacts; Yes to a New Model of Trade]]></title>

      <description><![CDATA[There's growing opposition to trade deals that the Obama administration is pushing and to so-called fast-track trade authority--an outdated mechanism that would limit Congressional and public oversight over trade negotiations. From <a href="http://fasttrackpoll.info/" target="_hplink">national polls</a> showing that a majority of Americans oppose putting the Trans-Pacific Partnership on the fast track to <a href="http://www.seattleglobalist.com/2014/01/29/5-reasons-to-protest-the-trans-pacific-partnership-this-week/19818" target="_hplink">demonstrations </a><a href="http://sierraclub.typepad.com/compass/2014/07/texas-democrats-band-together-to-oppose-fast-tracking-a-flawed-trade-deal.html" target="_hplink">across </a>the <a href="http://www.gazette.net/article/20140131/NEWS/140139705/1124/protesters-rally-against-trans-pacific-partnership-outside&template=gazette" target="_hplink">country </a>against fast tracking such deals, there's no denying that the tides are turning.<br />
<br />
The U.S. is negotiating what could be two of the world's biggest trade deals -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with Pacific Rim nations and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the European Union. But the meat of these deals goes beyond traditional trade issues like tariffs -- they deal with important everyday things, like our jobs, the safety of our food, and our access to clean water and air. The <a href="http://action.sierraclub.org/site/DocServer/0584_TPP_Report_03_low.pdf?docID=14641" target="_hplink">dangers </a>of these <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/Trade/truth-behind-ttip" target="_hplink">deals </a>seem endless, yet they're being rushed through in near complete secrecy. <br />
<br />
Trade negotiators are writing these deals behind closed doors, with little to no involvement of the public and our elected officials. Despite this, there is still a push in the U.S. administration and among some in Congress to even further limit public and Congressional oversight of these massive trade pacts. If fast track were to pass, for example, signed trade pacts like the TPP and TTIP could be rushed through Congress with a guaranteed vote in 90 days, a maximum of 20 hours debate, and no possibility for amendments. In other words, fast track makes it impossible for Congress to ensure that trade pacts actually deliver for workers, communities, and the environment.<br />
<br />
That's why today, nearly 600 national, regional, and local organizations are<a href="http://action.sierraclub.org/site/DocServer/Wyden_Fast_Track_Letter_Final.pdf?docID=16401" target="_hplink"> reiterating their opposition</a> to fast track and calling for a new model of trade. The time is now to fix the flawed model of trade that has <a href="http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2014/03/new-report-reveals-environmental-costs-north-american-free-trade-agreement" target="_hplink">cost us jobs and degraded our environment</a>.  <br />
<br />
Groups including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the AFL-CIO, the Communications Workers of America, the NAACP, and Public Citizen <a href="http://action.sierraclub.org/site/DocServer/Wyden_Fast_Track_Letter_Final.pdf?docID=16401" target="_hplink">sent a letter</a> to Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) firmly rejecting fast-track trade promotion authority and calling for a new system for negotiating and implementing trade agreements.<br />
<br />
The Sierra Club's executive director Michael Brune said it best: "Fast track is the wrong track for Americans who care about the health of our families and access to clean air, clean water, and land. We need a new model of trade -- one that protects communities and the environment while keeping the public engaged in the policy-making process."<br />
<br />
In January, then-Senator Max Baucus and Congressman Dave Camp introduced a fast-track bill, the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014, which would strip Congress of its ability to amend or sufficiently debate trade pacts. Sen. Wyden, the current Senate Finance Chairman, is now drafting a new trade authority bill.<br />
<br />
In place of the way-off fast-track method of rushing trade deals, the letter calls for a new model of trade authority that includes a number of key elements, including:<br />
A Congressional role in selecting trade partners;<br />
A set of mandatory negotiating objectives to ensure trade pacts deliver real benefits;<br />
Enhanced transparency, including the release of texts; and<br />
Congressional certification that negotiating objectives have been met before trade negotiations can conclude.<br />
<br />
Today's trade agreements affect our daily lives in countless ways. It's time that the process for negotiating and implementing these trade pacts evolves to reflect that reality. Congress has regularly created new trade authority mechanisms throughout history. Fast track first went into effect under President Nixon in the 1970s. It was last granted during the George W. Bush administration, but that law expired on June 30, 2007. And as our letter to Senator Wyden proves, it's time for something new.<br />
<br />
If this broad coalition of environmental organizations, labor unions, and organizations working at the center of public health, consumer rights, sustainable farming, and more can agree that a new model of trade that supports families and communities is absolutely necessary, then Congress should join with us and bring trade policy into the 21st century.  <br />
<br />
Ask your Members of Congress to take action in support of response trade and against fast track by <a href="https://secure.sierraclub.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=12351" target="_hplink">sending them a message here</a>. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<strong>By Mary Malia for <a href="http://www.yourtango.com/" target="_hplink">YourTango.com</a></strong><br />
<br />
Ladies, we're going to give it to you straight. After coming out, one of the reasons why it's sometimes hard for us to find love — or jump back into the dating field, for that matter — is because we end up getting in our own way. It makes sense that we're so caught up in figuring out the protocol for asking a woman that we miss out on a lot of opportunities. It's okay to be nervous about how to approach that girl that we ran into at the bookstore or on line at the coffee shop; we just have to remember that the only way that anything can happen is if we put ourselves out there. That being said, are there any dating rules that we can follow to make playing the field easier?<br />

<br />
When dating expert Mary Malia talks about ways to get out of our comfort zone and find love, she couldn't be more spot on. We don't need "gaydar" to crack the code of whether or not a woman is interested; we just have to get up and ask her! And if she ends up saying that she doesn't feel the same, we shouldn't take it so hard. Just brush it off and smile because the more you ask, there'll come a day when you get to that "Yes"!<br />

      <description><![CDATA[Before Connie Britton was a major TV star and Kirsten Gillibrand was a major national political force, the two women were friends at Dartmouth College.<br />
<br />
In a HuffPost Live interview on Tuesday, Britton reflected on the time they spent studying abroad together as students in China and how "awesome" and "fearless" the senator from New York was, even back then.<br />
<br />
"I'm so intensely proud of her and it's really inspiring to watch her because I do know what a powerhouse she is," the "Nashville" actress told host Ricky Camilleri. "She was like that when we were living in China together. She was already at that time a real leader amongst our students there and, you know, almost larger than life -- even back in college."<br />
<br />
She recalled how Gillibrand always had a strong sense of purpose, which she has demonstrated in her time on Capitol Hill. <br />
<br />
"She just knew who she was and she what she wanted, and, you know, you sort of jumped in line with that, or you didn't," Britton said. <br />
<br />
As Gillibrand fights for <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/06/gillibrands-military-sexual-assault_n_4913108.html" target="_hplink">justice for victims of sexual assault in the military</a> and on college campuses, we certainly hope others "jump in line."<br />
<br />
Today, Britton's happy to see her old friend fighting for values that she feels all Americans -- regardless of political affiliation -- can learn from. <br />
<br />
"Whatever your political beliefs are, I think sometimes it's easy to feel that our leaders aren't necessarily representing us in the way we want to be represented, and I think Kirsten is really out there fighting the good fight and doing it in a way that can set an example for all of us as Americans, but particularly people in politics" she explained. "So it's very exciting to watch her."<br />

      <description><![CDATA[Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York has been raising money for his reelection essentially since he took office in 2010. His campaign account has been in the eight figures since 2012; he's been raising $5 million or more every six months like clockwork. In Tuesday's New York Democratic gubernatorial primary, he won by a healthy margin, against a candidate who didn't raise much at all. ]]></description>

      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2014 11:42:33 -0400</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[Beltway policy wonks of all stripes are in a flurry after the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/foreign-powers-buy-influence-at-think-tanks.html?_r=1" target="_hplink">published an article</a> last Sunday alleging that foreign governments "buy influence" by funding U.S. think tanks. The article strongly suggested that some of Washington's most influential think tanks may have strayed from advocating policy positions that are based on independent research, instead venturing into partisan lobbying on behalf of their foreign funders, and in doing so possibly violating the <a href="http://www.fara.gov/" target="_hplink">Foreign Agents Registration Act</a>. <br />
<br />
To me, these allegations did not come as a great surprise, not least because <a href="http://www.transparify.org/blog/2014/4/29/secret-think-tank-funding-and-reputational-risk" target="_hplink">similar red flags</a> have been raised in the past. Transparify, the initiative I work for, <a href="https://static.squarespace.com/static/52e1f399e4b06a94c0cdaa41/t/536a108ee4b0e77a5729562c/1399459982820/How%20Transparent%20are%20Think%20Tanks%20(Transparify%2007May2014).pdf" target="_hplink">rated the financial transparency of 35 leading U.S. think tanks</a> earlier this year. We found that only ten of these research institutions were transparent about who funds them. Two prominent think tanks disclosed no information whatsoever on who funds them, let alone for what purposes. The opacity of the majority of think tanks about where they get their money from naturally fuels suspicions about hidden agendas, and sadly undermines the credibility of the sector as a whole. <br />
<br />
Think tanks are important players in U.S. democratic politics. By undertaking and communicating independent research, they can inform public debates and improve decision-making on policy, including on foreign policy. Conducting quality research costs money, and inevitably, journalists and other observers will sometimes <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/52e1f399e4b06a94c0cdaa41/t/53173ccae4b04f773bf8d18a/1394031818319/Think%20Tank%20Funding%20-%20An%20Overview%20of%20Current%20Debates%20_Transparify%202014_.pdf" target="_hplink">raise questions</a> about whether the policy recommendations coming out of such research were shaped by funders' agendas -- regardless of whether such funders are foundations, <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/52e1f399e4b06a94c0cdaa41/t/534bda65e4b036f444b56ecb/1397480037210/Corporate%20Interests%20and%20Think%20Tanks%20-%20An%20Overview%20of%20Current%20Debates%20_Transparify%202014_.pdf" target="_hplink">corporations</a>, trade unions, or foreign governments. Seen this way, it is no surprise that journalists and <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/52e1f399e4b06a94c0cdaa41/t/53173ccae4b04f773bf8d18a/1394031818319/Think%20Tank%20Funding%20-%20An%20Overview%20of%20Current%20Debates%20_Transparify%202014_.pdf" target="_hplink">regulators </a>have long struggled to determine <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/52e1f399e4b06a94c0cdaa41/t/53204216e4b04cff12000948/1394622998318/How%20Think%20Tanks%20Influence%20Policy%20-%20An%20Overview%20of%20Current%20Debates%20_Transparify%202014_.pdf" target="_hplink">where policy wonking ends and lobbying begins</a>, especially as sponsoring think tanks seems to have become a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/12/lobbying-10-ways-corprations-influence-government" target="_hplink">standard tactic for lobbyists</a> on both sides of the Atlantic.<br />
<br />
Policy makers, funders and think tanks themselves should positively welcome such scrutiny -- it's part and parcel of the democratic process, and a useful corrective against some journalists' tendency to uncritically quote findings by any entity that uses or abuses the think tank label, including <a href="http://www.transparify.org/blog/2014/3/12/how-a-fake-think-tank-deceived-97-of-journalists" target="_hplink">fake think tanks set up by professional lobbyists</a>, or to overlook some policy wonks' <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113158/report-dozens-lobbyists-work-think-tank-scholars" target="_hplink">glaring conflicts of interest</a>. (Somewhat ironically, the day after the <em>New York Times</em> alerted its readers to the risk posed by foreign funding of U.S. think tanks, it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/opinion/the-saudis-can-crush-isis.html" target="_hplink">published an op-ed</a> clearly intended to influence American foreign policy that was co-authored by a fellow of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/opinion/the-saudis-can-crush-isis.html?comments&_r=0#permid=12756917" target="_hplink">highly opaque research institution</a> that refuses to reveal where its money comes from.) At the same time, it is incredibly important to realize that accepting funding and compromising intellectual independence are not one and the same thing. But how can the public tell when the line has been crossed?<br />
<br />
For us, the answer is clear. Financial transparency is a necessary precondition for keeping think tanks accountable to the twin ideals of intellectual integrity and democratic politics. Only when we know who is funding whom, with how much, and for what research projects, can we begin to ask other important questions, such as which <a href="http://www.piie.com/content/?ID=138" target="_hplink">mechanisms </a>and <a href="http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1325-think-tank-transparency-bruegel-awarded-five-stars-by-transparify/" target="_hplink">firewalls </a>think tanks have put in place to ensure that their scholars are insulated from outside pressures, and whether these mechanisms are working well in practice. <br />
<br />
The good news is that think tanks themselves are waking up to the threat that opacity is posing to their credibility. In early 2014, <a href="http://www.transparify.org/updating/" target="_hplink">seven major U.S. think tanks</a> told us that they were planning to put more information online before the year is over, and several others since then have signalled that they too are getting ready to walk the transparency talk. In December 2014, Transparify will start re-assessing all institutions we rated earlier this year, allowing us to track and <a href="http://www.transparify.org/our-methodology/" target="_hplink">precisely quantify</a> this shift towards greater transparency. <br />

The debate about think tanks' intellectual independence is <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/52e1f399e4b06a94c0cdaa41/t/530c62e6e4b004006c679e6f/1393320678738/Think%20Tank%20Transparency%20-%20An%20Overview%20of%20Current%20Debates%20_Transparify%202014_.pdf" target="_hplink">only just beginning</a>, and many serious research outfits are getting ready to <a href="http://www.transparify.org/5-star/" target="_hplink">open their books</a> and engage in a constructive dialogue with their critics. For example, over the last few days alone, the Peterson Institute has placed additional information on <a href="http://www.piie.com/content/?ID=133" target="_hplink">its funders</a> online, and the <em>New York Times</em> article has sparked a very <a href="http://davidroodman.com/blog/2014/09/07/confessions-of-a-foreign-agent-unmasked/" target="_hplink">thoughtful response</a> and an <a href="http://onthinktanks.org/2014/09/10/think-tank-accountability-are-they-really-just-hired-guns/" target="_hplink">excellent analysis</a> of the issues at stake. <br />
<br />
The key words here are debate and dialogue. Before we all begin casting stones, let's remember that most self-respecting think tanks, most of the time, have absolutely nothing to hide, and that they too <a href="http://www.transparify.org/blog/2014/5/6/a-culture-of-transparency-at-the-world-resources-institute" target="_hplink">realize that their impact on policy hinges on their credibility</a> as independent sources of research and policy advice. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[For all those who might have an interest in the future of France, I invite you to join me here, on October 2: Its fate, on that day, will be sealed, for a long time. By this date, in fact, our country at last will have to make the choices that it has stubbornly refused to make over the last 20 years, in spite of all the advice, the books and the talk.<br />
Let us recap the important dates this month:<br />
- This Wednesday, September 10, the government has to make its decision known about the path chosen for 2015. This choice is critical, as it decides the fate of the country until 2016, presidential election year in principle, during which everyone will rush to do nothing. The choices that needed to be decided before that Wednesday were extraordinarily high. Should we admit to the French people that government deficits are not under control and that France will soon join the sad club of countries whose public debt exceeds its GDP? Should we resign ourselves to deficits permanently above 4% of GDP, unlike the deficits of all other European countries? Or, on the contrary, should huge reform efforts and cruel savings be finally made to control these ill-effects? Should taxes be increased further? And which ones? Should we resign ourselves to a suicidal deflation? Should the forces of economic growth be unleashed and instead unleash the coalition of all conservatism? I have an answer to these questions. I do not know, in these instants in which I write, the one that will be given by the government. The further timetable is not an incentive to audacity...<br />
- Friday, September 12, the budget structure must be communicated to the French Senate and the other European countries, whose finance ministers will convene in Milan for that to happen.<br />
- Tuesday, September 16, the Prime Minister must ask for a vote of confidence from the Parliament, all the more difficult to obtain if he makes the tough choices, to which nobody has prepared the country.<br />
- Thursday, September 18, the President of the Republic will give the fourth bi-annual press conference of his mandate.<br />
- Wednesday, September 24, or a few days later due to a visit by the French President at the United Nations, the detailed budget will be presented in the Council of Ministers and, Thursday, October 2, tabled in Parliament.<br />
- On Sunday, September 28 election for the French Senate will be held.<br />
All, then, will be over.<br />
If this Wednesday, the government chooses the courageous solution, which is to purge all prior deviations in order to gain more leeway, it will have to announce savings of over 25 billion in 2015, and an increase of at least two percentage points in value added tax, or as many small tax contributions infinitely more painful; it might then fear of not having the approval of the Parliament six days later.<br />
If this is not done, France will be, with Italy, the only European country refusing to reform. The only country on the road to bankruptcy and the ruin of its people. The only country called, rightly, by its European partners, « cigale prétentieuse, » foolish coward, gravedigger of the European Union. The latter could (should even, under the Treaties) put our country under guardianship and send its representatives to set the budget for us, as was the case in Greece and Portugal. Exactly as one treats a person incapable of managing his own finances.<br />
Here is the choice. Here are the key issues. Instead of dealing with nauseous anecdotes, politicians, Left and Right, should debate publicly only this question: What to do until next October 2d?<br />
That day I will say what I think about what the political power will have decided for the future of our country: Will it have the fortitude to act or be laboured under the illusion that it still has time? Will it believe that everyone can stand alone? Or will it continue to maintain a juxtaposition of pressure groups begging each for a greater and greater slice of a cake that is getting increasingly smaller?<br />
It is ultimately its decision. You be the judge. See you on 2 October.<br />

      <description><![CDATA[I recently interviewed Harry DeMell, an immigration lawyer since 1977 and a member of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, about the current immigration crisis.<br />
<br />
Schupak: So, Harry. Is it true that you believe that President Obama is not handling the immigration reform issue properly by putting it off until after the elections?<br />
<br />
DeMell: Absolutely. He should outline his ideas now and allow the issue to be vetted in front of the American public. The American voting public has a right to know the direction that our president plans to go and there should be public debate in this area. After all, didn't President Obama run on a platform of open and transparent government?<br />
<br />
Schupak: The President has stated that he is not ready to present his ideas to the public since that are not yet ready.<br />
<br />
DeMell: Andy. Come on. After six years in office the president knows what he wants to do. He now needs to have the courage of his convictions to tell America and let the debate begin.<br />
<br />
Schupak: The President does not want to make this a campaign issue. <br />
<br />
DeMell: The President needs to have the courage of his convictions. He might want to read "Profiles in Courage" by John Kennedy. If he really believes he is right let him explain it to the American people and show us why he is correct. He needs to lead. <br />
<br />
Schupak: What do you think he will do? <br />
<br />
DeMell: That's a two-part question. First I think he will wait until after the election to unveil his plan.<br />
<br />
Schupak: And part two?<br />
<br />
DeMell: After the election he will unveil a plan to grant some flavor of temporary protected status to people here since a cut off date to be announced, so long as they have no criminal record. He might limit it to people with some family member here. He might extend it to the children who have come during the last two years since the president issued the last executive order allowing prior juvenile aliens to stay. They will be allowed to stay and work and later travel. This will be extended indefinitely as it always is.<br />
<br />
Schupak: Doesn't that seem to be the humane thing to do? After all these people are already here, working and not causing trouble.<br />
<br />
DeMell: It is absolutely terrible. It sends a signal that anyone who can come to our shores can stay legally. There is no end to it. Millions will come to await the next 'program'. If we open our doors unconditionally hundreds of millions would want to come.<br />
<br />
Schupak: There are many who believe that we can absorb many more people and that America has the compassion and resources to do this.<br />
<br />
DeMell: Tell that to the unemployed and underemployed. Tell that to the African American community where these rates are effectively twice that of others in America. Tell that to the taxpayers who will be footing the bills for services these people will need.<br />
<br />
Schupak: If the President thinks that some of his proposals would be unpopular don't you think waiting until after the election makes perfect sense?<br />
<br />
DeMell: Exactly. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[There is a great debate afoot in the nation's capital about the downsizing of the U.S. military in a time when new and more ominous threats seem to be emerging on every hand. The Russians are rustling their sabers in Ukraine, the Chinese are challenging our aircraft in Asia and yet another force of Islamic terrorists is on the march in the Mideast. <br />
<br />
President Obama had made a big deal out of extricating our troops from Iraq and is now doing the same with Afghanistan.  But it is clear our attempt at nation building in Iraq is not finished and we may soon discover the same about Afghanistan. If those nations dissolve into chaos and anarchy, all of our sacrifice will be in vain and the world will be a more perilous place. The rising threat of the nihilistic Islamic force trying to forge a new regime of blood and terror across Iraq and Syria only underscores the challenge we face.<br />
<br />
While all this is going on, Congress is chopping back on military spending with little consideration of the potential consequences. Already, the U.S. Army is being cut from an Iraq-Afghanistan peak of 566,000 to about 450,000 and the budget calls for further cuts. <br />
<br />
But calculating the actual numbers of boots on the ground requires care. As with all government agencies, the Pentagon is relying more and more on private sector contractors to perform many basic functions. Overall, there are actually fewer people on the federal payroll today -- about 2 million -- than when Ronald Reagan was president -- 2.3 million. But that doesn't mean the government is smaller. Many jobs once performed by federal employees are today being performed by private contractors. <br />
<br />
The Defense Department for example has about 800,000 civilian workers plus about 700,000 full time contract employees. The Pentagon is spending about $300 billion a year on private contractors that perform a variety of functions that used to be done by people in uniform. This was happening way back when I commanded military bases -- Forts Gordon and Huachuca -- and I thought then and now it made good sense. We needed our military personnel training for combat missions, not cooking breakfast or cleaning living quarters. Contracting out many support functions enhanced our fighting ability.<br />
<br />
But the question how many people we should have in uniform remains. The specter of dangerous adversaries around the globe pursuing aggressive actions against our interests underscores the critical need to keep our defense strong. Since 2010, inflation adjusted defense spending has fallen 21 percent -- a draconian cutback. We are spending a paltry 3.4 percent of our gross domestic product on defense and it is scheduled to fall even more. Like many others, I believe it should be at least 4 percent and a substantial portion of that should go to support boots on the ground. Air power is important, but ground forces decide the outcome. <br />

      <description><![CDATA[One of the hottest U.S. House seat races in the country is going on right now in Colorado. The 6th Congressional district, located just outside Denver, features three-term Republican Representative Mike Coffman running against Democratic challenger Andrew Romanoff.<br />
<br />
What's so special about this race? Yes, it's likely to be a very close one, but it's unlikely to be pivotal -- the Republican House majority is not facing a serious threat this year. And yes, it's somewhat novel in that a Republican incumbent appears in danger of losing to a Democratic challenger, which is somewhat the opposite partisan pattern we've seen elsewhere in the country this year.<br />
<br />
But at least for political scientists and other political observers, it's a fascinating race because so many of the fundamentals of politics are in play and at war with each other. To wit:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>REDISTRICTING: Coffman was originally elected in 2008 to represent a very conservative district, the same one that Tom Tancredo had represented before him. A substantial redrawing of this district after 2010 made it much more moderate, however. President Bush won this district 60-39 in 2004; President Obama won it in 2012 52-47.</li><br />
<br />
<li>RECRUITMENT: One of the best predictors of how the out-party will do in elections is how effective they've been in recruiting strong challengers. Romanoff is a very strong challenger. He was a four-term state House member from Denver and served as the speaker of that chamber between 2005 and 2008, then the youngest speaker in Colorado history. He remains extremely popular among Democratic activists, has strong name identification throughout the state, and is an accomplished fundraiser and skilled debater. Democrats had recruited a somewhat less accomplished and less well known nominee in 2012 to challenge Coffman. That candidate, Joe Miklosi, lost by just two points. Romanoff's relative quality might be enough to close that gap. But this is related to... </li><br />
<br />
<li>PARTISAN TIDES: There was a modest Democratic tilt to the entire electorate in 2012, as Obama was at the top of the ticket and winning nationwide. This year's electorate is likely to have somewhat of a Republican lean, in part due to Obama's middling approval ratings and in part due to the traditional anti-presidential turnout bias in mid-term elections. If Romanoff had been running two years ago, he'd probably have taken down Coffman. This year, that task will be harder. But that's all tied into...</li><br />
<br />
<li>TURNOUT: Yes, it matters that this isn't a presidential election. Obama won't be at the top of the ticket, which means far fewer Democrats will turn out. At the same time, though, this election will take place in a state that is seeing very competitive and well funded contests for both U.S. Senate and governor. Senator Mark Udall, the Democrat running for re-election, is notably borrowing from Senator Michael Bennet's playbook from 2010, which involved heavy use of local field offices to boost turnout. The voter turnout efforts from those races will likely spill over into the 6th congressional district race.</li><br />
<br />
<li>POSITIONING: Coffman has moved leftward on a number of issues in the past few years, including immigration and personhood, in the hopes of improving his chances for re-election. While there are some risks to this, exposing him to accusations of flip-flopping, it can also potentially offer significant payoffs. Voters are known to punish incumbents who seem to vote with their party too often, and Coffman is now better positioned than he was a few years ago.</li><br />
<br />
<li>SPENDING: Both the candidates are effective fundraisers, having raised roughly $3.5 million each so far this year, and they're being backed heavily by the national parties and a broad array of outside money. This money is being used to buy up pretty much every available advertising slot between now and November, and to fund a range of voter turnout efforts. At least so far, it looks like spending will be a wash, as the candidates are pretty well matched. But Romanoff has interestingly foresworn PAC money (even though that doesn't appear to be hurting his bottom line). Perhaps this will make a difference in the end, but given the relatively modest impact of spending on election results and the fact that the candidates are near parity, this is unlikely to be a major factor.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<br />
All in all, this is proving to be an exciting race that will have much to teach us when it's all over. But there are so many variables in play here, it's hard to know just which lessons we'll be learning.<br />

      <description><![CDATA[At ninety-five, as a businessman and philanthropist, I want to call attention to little-known ploys in US philanthropy that rob our society of hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for important charitable causes—leaving money stashed away in financial institutions and doing no good for anyone except money managers and other financial intermediaries.<br />
<br />
In the past twenty years, I’ve given away close to $500 million of my own money. After I pioneered the leveraged buyout in 1964, I watched how innovators, imitators, and swarming incompetents tore the companies they acquired apart. Then when I graduated into what I like to call my “distributive phase,” I saw how private foundations were able to take unfair advantages of the charitable deduction. ]]></description>
