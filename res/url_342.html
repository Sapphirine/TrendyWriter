The answer is simple: these are no ordinary birds.</p>
<p>For the past four months, Cole and Gary Cooper of Cooper Farms in western Ohio have been raising a pair of turkeys that will on Thursday have the pleasure of avoiding the dinner table. As the chairman of the National Turkey Federation, Cooper got the privilege of being home of the turkey &mdash and the back-up turkey&mdash  that will get pardoned by the President in the annual Turkey pardoning ceremony.</p>
<div class="galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded" data-gallery="3606109" data-size="default"></div>
<p>Gary Cooper told TIME before heading to the District that having the opportunity to raise the presidential turkey is the &ldquo pinnacle of the turkey industry&rdquo  which raised over 240 million turkeys last year&mdash 46 million of which were eaten at Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>&ldquo It&rsquo s a real honor to be able to chosen to do this,&rdquo  said Gary, whose farm has been in his family for generations. &ldquo The whole thing is just a very positive experience for not just my family, but the whole industry and the nation.&rdquo </p>
<p>The two-decade old tradition of having the sitting President goofily wave his hands over a nonchalant bird after a brief speech on Thanksgiving morning is often mocked and, at times, compared to the pardoning of actual (human) prisoners. <i>Last Week Tonight</i> host John Oliver recently questioned why we bother pardoning turkeys at all given they&rsquo re all &ldquo guilty of being delicious.&rdquo  Yet, it&rsquo s one of those harmless traditions likely to stick around.</p>
<p>Life on the farm has been pretty luxurious for the two male, broad-breasted white birds who have been chosen, which were named Mac and Cheese on Wednesday. Cole, 29, built a custom red barn for the flock of potential presidential turkeys he raised near his home. Their dwellings have been kept at a cool 75 degrees for their comfort and they&rsquo ve been free to roam in and out of the barn at their will, as long as Cole has been around to make sure the birds don&rsquo t become dinner for local predators. They&rsquo ve also become pretty fond of Kenny Chesney (in their opinion, Cole says, <i>Life on a Rock</i> is his best work). But between their cozy barn in Ohio and their future home at Morven Park in Virginia, the birds will be a little more restricted.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3607281"></div>
<p>In recent years, Leslee Oden and Damon Wells of the National Turkey Federation have been preparing hotel rooms for turkeys and they&rsquo ve picked up some handy tricks along the way. For instance, two six-foot folding tables can easily be fashioned into a blockade for a bird. Brown paper is a sturdy barrier between a precocious turkey&rsquo s peck and the hotels baseboards. And the foyer of the deluxe room with two queen beds at the four-star hotel (currently $229 per night) is the ideal space for the birds.</p>
<p>We roll out the massive strips of tape on the ornate carpet as I toss out questions about life for the birds B.O. (before meeting Obama) and what life will be like after. I ask if we&rsquo re cutting the brown paper the &ldquo hotdog way&rdquo  as a nod to my kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Snyder. And we discuss the varying breeds of turkeys the Coopers raised in the lead up to Thursday&rsquo s ceremony, including Spanish black, blue slate, and bronze turkeys.. In a conversation with TIME, Cole said the two &ldquo chosen&rdquo  birds essentially picked themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo I was actually in the barn on Wednesday, just like any other night to see how they&rsquo re interacting with each other,&rdquo  Cole said last Friday. &ldquo And these two birds just walk up to me and started strutting. It was like they said, &lsquo hey, we&rsquo re ready to go.&rsquo &rdquo </p>
<p>Much like their digs at Cooper Farms, the tape-lined carpet of the Willard is covered with pine-shavings and outfitted with a feeder strategically placed on top of a mini garbage can. Aside from providing familiar flooring, the pine shavings also make the looming task of scooping up their, um, <i>waste</i> easy.</p>
<p>It took a little over an hour to prepare the room for the birds, who still hadn&rsquo t arrived when I left, but got more than enough of their share of the spotlight during a media event on Tuesday.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3607281"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

Indeed, the preponderance of forensic and eyewitness testimony suggests that Wilson was acting in self-defense against a violent perpetrator. But the eyewitness testimony is muddled, even among the local residents who supported Wilson   s version of the story. It is amazing how fast violence happens, how hard it is to remember events accurately. And so the grand jury couldn   t say 8211 wasn   t asked to say 8211 what actually happened on August 9 in Ferguson.</p>

The question is, do Michael Brown   s parents 8211 and the rest of us 8211 deserve to have the facts laid out, the case against Wilson argued in a court of law? Undoubtedly, there will be such a case 8211 a federal case or a civil case, brought by the parents. But a grand jury indictment, even on a lesser charge like manslaughter, would have lent appropriate seriousness to a contested, foggy situation. It would have indicated, at the very least, that the evidence wasn   t dispositive and the situation required further public attention.</p>
<p>Several things are absolutely clear, though. The authorities in Missouri, from Ferguson to St. Louis County to the governor   s office, have bungled this case from the start. That Michael Brown   s body was allowed to lie in the street for four hours is inexcusable. That crucial evidence 8211 Wilson   s gun 8211 was not dusted for prints is mystifying and incompetent. And then there was the Monday spectacle of a verdict reached, but not announced until after dark. Sheer idiocy.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded" data-gallery="3603442" data-size="default"></div></p>
<p>But there can no longer be a question that the initial accounts of the case were fraudulent. Michael Brown was not a gentle giant. He was not shot in the back. There was a scuffle of some sort between Brown and Wilson, perhaps with Brown trying to gain control of the police officer   s gun. There was, apparently, at least one shot fired at close range. Brown ran away, then turned and charged the officer.</p>
<p><a href="http://time.com/3153340/beyond-a-simple-solution-for-ferguson/" target="_blank">Again, as I wrote a few weeks ago</a>, Wilson   s actions may have been justifiable under the law in Missouri, but he is not entirely exonerated: the death would have been preventable if he had been better trained. Still, you can   t indict Wilson for not abiding by training he didn   t receive. And you can   t elide the facts of the case. Wilson clearly panicked. He thought his life was in danger. He killed a young man. He should have to defend these actions publicly, under the fierce pressure of cross-examination.</p>
<p>There will now be still more calls for a discussion about race in America. But that conversation can not simply be about white guilt or prejudice. The latter certainly does exist  it exists overwhelmingly, disgracefully. But the assumptions that lead police, and bodega owners, to racial profiling are real 8211 and those must be discussed, too. Liberals have avoided this conversation for 50 years, since crime rates exploded in the 1960s. And by doing so, they have done a real disservice to the disproportionate number of crime victims who are African-Americans, urban and poor. Poverty is no excuse for criminality. People who commit crimes are perpetrators, not victims. Indeed, blaming poverty for criminality is an insult to the vast majority of poor blacks who play by the rules 8211 graduate from high school or college, find a job, are responsible parents 8211 and have improved their lives as a result. As the President said, you can   t gainsay the fact that there has been enormous progress over the past 40 years&hellip with more to come, as a new generation of polychromatic, unprejudiced young people take charge.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3605266"></div>

<p>Back in the 1980s, my wife and I lived in a mostly-black neighborhood in New York. Our neighbors were placed in an impossible position: they were infuriated that many of the police who patrolled (or, more often, failed to patrol) our streets treated them as if they were criminals, but they also were terrified of, and infuriated by, the criminals who made it a life-threatening challenge to go down to the corner for a quart of milk. We had some real conversations in those days 8211 about crime, about the double-edged sword of affirmative action, about the hilariously stupid racial assumptions they encountered in the city. Some of our neighbors were public employees  others weren   t and were pissed off about the level of service they were receiving. There were intense conversations about whether it was  8220 racist 8221  to fire incompetents on the public payroll. I miss those conversations. They required a certain amount of candor and subtlety. They would have been impossible for ideologues, because the reality on our block defied any ideology. And they probably would have been impossible in public, since it was very hard for our neighbors to criticize young black men who had grown up in anger-infusing chaos.</p>
<p>It is sad, but inevitable, that there will be two conversations about Ferguson. One will be public, one will be private. The public conversation will be dominated by rant, oversimplification and guilt-mongering. The private conversation will be unspeakable in segments of the white, Asian and Latino communities. If my experience in the 1980s is any guide, the conversations in the black community will be more reasonable, marked by anger, pain, embarrassment and the difficulties of dealing with kids like Michael Brown. It   s a national tragedy that we can   t seem to have that conversation in public, that political correctness stands directly athwart honesty in this republic of free speech.</p>

	<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">Compared to 125 last year this time</h2>
    <p>Over 450,000 people <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7293429/obamacare-enrollment-first-week" target="_blank">signed up for health insurance</a> via the healthcare.gov website during the first week of open enrollment, the Obama administration said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services says 462, 125 people signed up for insurance between Nov. 15 and Nov. 21. Nearly half of those enrollees were new customers, <em>Vox</em> <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7293429/obamacare-enrollment-first-week" target="_blank">reports</a>.</p>
<p>Last year during the first month of the rocky rollout of Obama&rsquo s signature health care law, only about 106,000 people signed up for insurance.</p>
<p>Enrollment via the Spanish-language version of healthcare.gov, however, lags. The site has had about 95,000 users since the second enrollment period began.</p>
<p>The release of figures after the first week is a part of an Obama Administration effort to be more transparent about how many people are signing up for insurance via the health care marketplace.</p>

	<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">After experiencing discomfort, the 81-year-old justice was taken to the hospital where a blockage was discovered </h2>
    <p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent heart surgery on Wednesday. The 81-year-old justice is said to be &ldquo resting comfortably&rdquo  and will likely be released within the next 48 hours, according to a Supreme Court release.</p>
<p>Ginsburg had a stent &mdash  a small mesh tube that supports narrow or weak arteries &mdash  implanted in her right coronary artery. She reportedly felt discomfort during exercise on Tuesday and was taken to MedStar Washington Hospital Center where a blockage was discovered.</p>
<p>This is the latest health issue for Ginsburg, who was treated for cancer in 1999 and 2009. The justice has been called on to retire by many on the left who want her to give up her seat so President Obama can appoint a left-leaning successor, though with the Senate soon in Republican hands many think it   s likely too late.</p>
<p>At any rate, Ginsburg isn   t planning on going anywhere soon. In an interview with <a href="http://www.elle.com/life-love/society-career/supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg" target="_blank"><em>Elle</em></a> in September, Ginsburg quashed rumors that she had plans to step down.</p>
<p>&ldquo As long as I can do the job full steam&hellip . I think I&rsquo ll recognize when the time comes that I can&rsquo t any longer. But now I can,&rdquo  Ginsburg said.</p>

		<div class="video-content"><p>Nothing could be a more soothing&mdash and more bizarre&mdash than listening to Speaker of the House John Boehner explain in his resonant bass voice how he cooks his turkey for Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The most powerful Republican in Congress revealed  8220 The Boehner Brine, 8221  the perfect Thanksgiving turkey in a video released Tuesday.</p>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="500">
<p>Been perfecting the Boehner <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/brine?src=hash">#brine</a> recipe for years. This is the result: <a href="http://t.co/VxzXAUwm45">http://t.co/VxzXAUwm45</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HappyThanksgiving?src=hash">#HappyThanksgiving</a></p>
<p>&mdash  Speaker John Boehner (@SpeakerBoehner) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerBoehner/status/537608188028522497">November 26, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Like a besuited Martha Stewart, Boehner tells the camera with a roguish cock of the head,  8220 Now, I only cook my bird to about 160, max. 8221  He adds,  8220 And then I take it out and I put foil over it and let it sit for at least an hour, 8221  punctuating his culinary strategy with a subtle finger point like a scat singer acknowledging a fan on the Las Vegas strip.</p>
<p>The video also includes footage of Boehner in what is presumably his kitchen, wearing a flattering green apron over a crisp shirt far too white for messy cooking. But what   s the real secret to the turkey brine?  8220 Sixteen ounces of <em>pure</em> maple syrup, 8221  Boehner says.</p>

	<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">The charity faces major backlash for its decision to give an award to former British prime minister</h2>
    <p>A week after the U.S. branch of Save the Children (STC) presented Tony Blair with a  8220 global legacy award 8221  in New York, almost 200 staff at the charity<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/25/save-the-children-furious-charity-global-legacy-tony-blair" target="_blank"> have signed an internal letter saying the award is</a>  8220 inappropriate and a betrayal to Save the Children   s founding principles and values. 8221 </p>
<p>The letter says that U.K. management were not consulted about the award and want it to be withdrawn since it was not only  8220 morally reprehensible, but also endangers our credibility globally. 8221 </p>
<p>The American arm of STC presented Blair with the award at a gala at the Plaza Hotel in New York on Nov. 19 for his  8220 leadership on international development 8221 , citing his debt relief work and the <a href="http://www.makepovertyhistory.org/takeaction/" target="_blank">Make Poverty History campaign</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/stop-save-the-children-charity-from-giving-tony-blair-their-annual-global-legacy-award?bucket=blast" target="_blank">separate online petition</a> calling for STC to revoke the award says Blair   s  8220 legacy in Iraq overshadows his achievements in Africa 8221 , adding that many see him  8220 as the cause of the deaths of countless children in the Middle East. 8221  The petition had gathered more than 97,000 signatures by Tuesday morning.</p>

They argued the ban violated the U.S. Constitution and discriminated based on sexual orientation.</p>
<p> 8220 The fact that Amendment 83 was adopted by referendum does not immunize it from federal constitutional scrutiny, 8221  Baker wrote in her ruling.</p>
<p>Besides the amendment, Mississippi has a 1997 law that bans same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>But U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves wrote in his ruling,  8220 The Fourteenth Amendment operates to remove the blinders of inequality from our eyes. Though we cherish our traditional values, they must give way to constitutional wisdom. Mississippi   s traditional beliefs about gay and lesbian citizens led it to defy that wisdom by taking away fundamental rights owed to every citizen. It is time to restore those rights.</p>
<p> 8220 Today   s decision may cause uneasiness and concern about the change it will bring, 8221  he wrote.  8220 But  8220    (t)hings change, people change, times change, and Mississippi changes, too.    The man who said these words, Ross R. Barnett, Jr., knew firsthand their truth. 8221 </p>
<p>Barnett Jr. is an attorney and son of segregationist Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett, who was in office from 1960 to 1964.</p>
<p>The ruling was similar in Arkansas.</p>
<p>The state   s marriage laws and the amendment violate the U.S. Constitution by  8220 precluding same-sex couples from exercising their fundamental right to marry in Arkansas, by not recognizing valid same-sex marriages from other states, and by discriminating on the basis of gender, 8221  Baker wrote.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3607158"></div>
<p>Baker put the ruling on hold, anticipating an appeal to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in St. Louis.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Democratic Attorney General Dustin McDaniel said McDaniel was reviewing the ruling and would decide after the Thanksgiving holiday whether to appeal in consultation with Republican Attorney General-elect Leslie Rutledge in Arkansas.</p>
<p>Mississippi officials had already said they planned to appeal any ruling that overturned the law.</p>
<p>Judges across the country have ruled against bans similar to Arkansas    since the U.S. Supreme Court struck part of a federal anti-gay marriage law in June 2013, and gay marriage is legal in more than half of the U.S.</p>
<p>Jack Wagoner, a lawyer for the Arkansas couples who had told the judge last week that same-sex marriage would eventually be legal nationwide, said he was pleased with her decision.</p>
<p> 8220 She   s on the right side of history, 8221  Wagoner said.  8220 It   s pretty clear where history   s heading on this issue. 8221 </p>
<p>Another lawyer, Cheryl Maples, said eyes would turn now to the Arkansas Supreme Court, which heard arguments last week in a similar but separate case.</p>
<p> 8220 If the state Supreme Court strikes down on state constitutional issues, then it   s gone as far as it can go, 8221  Maples said.</p>
<p>Justices are weighing whether to uphold a decision in May striking down the 2004 amendment and earlier state law as unconstitutional. The decision led to 541 same sex couples getting married in the week before the state Supreme Court suspended his ruling.</p>
<p>Justices have not indicated when they will rule in that case.</p>
<p>Lawyers in McDaniel   s office had argued in federal court that same-sex marriage was not a fundamental right guaranteed by the constitution. McDaniel has said he personally supports allowing gay couples to marry but will stay in court defending the ban, which voters approved by a 3-1 margin.</p>
<p>One of Mississippi   s plaintiff couples, Jocelyn  8220 Joce 8221  (JOH   -see) Pritchett and Carla Webb, live in Mississippi and married in Maine in 2013. Pritchett said Tuesday that she, Webb and their two young children were dancing around their living room after hearing about Reeves    ruling.</p>
<p> 8220 If gay marriage can be legal in Mississippi, the whole country can feel hope, 8221  Pritchett said.</p>

<p>Speaking in Chicago before a scheduled speech on immigration reform, the President acknowledged that many Americans are upset by the decision but appealed for calm.</p>
<p> 8220 Burning buildings, torching cars, destroying property, putting people at risk, that   s destructive and there   s no excuse for it, 8221  Obama said.  8220 Those are criminal acts. People should be prosecuted if they commit criminal acts.&rdquo </p>
<p>He continued,  8220 nothing of significance, nothing of benefit results from destructive acts. 8221 </p>
<div class="galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded" data-gallery="3604712" data-size="default"></div>
<p>Obama also said he is deploying Attorney General Eric Holder to lead regional discussions to address the roots of the crisis in Ferguson: Distrust between law enforcement officials and the local community. He called on those dissatisfied by the grand jury   s decision not to take the easy route of violence, but rather to come together to improve their communities.</p>
<p> 8220 To those that think that what happened in Ferguson is an excuse for violence, I do not have any sympathy for them, 8221  he added. &ldquo I have no sympathy at all for destroying your own communities.&rdquo </p>
<p>Obama was briefed by Holder on Monday evening   s violence in Ferguson, and members of his administration have been working to diffuse tensions. White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters aboard Air Force One that the President   s senior advisor Valerie Jarett spoke with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Monday night and Tuesday morning to receive updates from the ground. Broderick Johnson, the White House cabinet secretary, convened a call with the Missouri delegation Monday evening.</p>
<p>Also on Monday, White House staffers held a call with mayors across the country, while Jarrett and Holder spoke with civil rights leaders. Schultz added that Obama would consider visiting the city once  8220 things calm down a little bit. 8221 </p>

The answer is simple: these are no ordinary birds.<\/p>\n<p>For the past four months, Cole and Gary Cooper of Cooper Farms in western Ohio have been raising a pair of turkeys that will on Thursday have the pleasure of avoiding the dinner table. As the chairman of the National Turkey Federation, Cooper got the privilege of being home of the turkey &mdash and the back-up turkey&mdash  that will get pardoned by the President in the annual Turkey pardoning ceremony.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3606109\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>Gary Cooper told TIME before heading to the District that having the opportunity to raise the presidential turkey is the &ldquo pinnacle of the turkey industry&rdquo  which raised over 240 million turkeys last year&mdash 46 million of which were eaten at Thanksgiving.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo It&rsquo s a real honor to be able to chosen to do this,&rdquo  said Gary, whose farm has been in his family for generations. &ldquo The whole thing is just a very positive experience for not just my family, but the whole industry and the nation.&rdquo <\/p>\n<p>The two-decade old tradition of having the sitting President goofily wave his hands over a nonchalant bird after a brief speech on Thanksgiving morning is often mocked and, at times, compared to the pardoning of actual (human) prisoners. <i>Last Week Tonight<\/i> host John Oliver recently questioned why we bother pardoning turkeys at all given they&rsquo re all &ldquo guilty of being delicious.&rdquo  Yet, it&rsquo s one of those harmless traditions likely to stick around.<\/p>\n<p>Life on the farm has been pretty luxurious for the two male, broad-breasted white birds who have been chosen, which were named Mac and Cheese on Wednesday. Cole, 29, built a custom red barn for the flock of potential presidential turkeys he raised near his home. Their dwellings have been kept at a cool 75 degrees for their comfort and they&rsquo ve been free to roam in and out of the barn at their will, as long as Cole has been around to make sure the birds don&rsquo t become dinner for local predators. They&rsquo ve also become pretty fond of Kenny Chesney (in their opinion, Cole says, <i>Life on a Rock<\/i> is his best work). But between their cozy barn in Ohio and their future home at Morven Park in Virginia, the birds will be a little more restricted.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3607281\"><\/div>\n<p>In recent years, Leslee Oden and Damon Wells of the National Turkey Federation have been preparing hotel rooms for turkeys and they&rsquo ve picked up some handy tricks along the way. For instance, two six-foot folding tables can easily be fashioned into a blockade for a bird. Brown paper is a sturdy barrier between a precocious turkey&rsquo s peck and the hotels baseboards. And the foyer of the deluxe room with two queen beds at the four-star hotel (currently $229 per night) is the ideal space for the birds.<\/p>\n<p>We roll out the massive strips of tape on the ornate carpet as I toss out questions about life for the birds B.O. (before meeting Obama) and what life will be like after. I ask if we&rsquo re cutting the brown paper the &ldquo hotdog way&rdquo  as a nod to my kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Snyder. And we discuss the varying breeds of turkeys the Coopers raised in the lead up to Thursday&rsquo s ceremony, including Spanish black, blue slate, and bronze turkeys.. In a conversation with TIME, Cole said the two &ldquo chosen&rdquo  birds essentially picked themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo I was actually in the barn on Wednesday, just like any other night to see how they&rsquo re interacting with each other,&rdquo  Cole said last Friday. &ldquo And these two birds just walk up to me and started strutting. It was like they said, &lsquo hey, we&rsquo re ready to go.&rsquo &rdquo <\/p>\n<p>Much like their digs at Cooper Farms, the tape-lined carpet of the Willard is covered with pine-shavings and outfitted with a feeder strategically placed on top of a mini garbage can. Aside from providing familiar flooring, the pine shavings also make the looming task of scooping up their, um, <i>waste<\/i> easy.<\/p>\n<p>It took a little over an hour to prepare the room for the birds, who still hadn&rsquo t arrived when I left, but got more than enough of their share of the spotlight during a media event on Tuesday.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3607281\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=This%20is%20How%20You%20Prepare%20a%20Hotel%20Room%20for%20Presidential%20Turkeys%20%7C%20TIME&body=This%20is%20How%20You%20Prepare%20a%20Hotel%20Room%20for%20Presidential%20Turkeys%0A%0ABirds%20who%E2%80%99ve%20grown%20accustomed%20to%20a%20particular%20lifestyle%20require%20special%20attention%E2%80%94especially%20when%20they%E2%80%99re%20about%20to%20meet%20the%20President%20%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3607281%2Fturkey-pardon-obama-hotel%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3607281%2Fturkey-pardon-obama-hotel%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f8pX&text=This%20is%20how%20you%20prepare%20a%20hotel%20room%20for%20presidential%20turkeys&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3607281%2Fturkey-pardon-obama-hotel%2F&title=This+is+How+You+Prepare+a+Hotel+Room+for+Presidential+Turkeys\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3607281\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3607281\/turkey-pardon-obama-hotel\/\" data-title=\"This is How You Prepare a Hotel Room for Presidential Turkeys\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

The question is, do Michael Brown   s parents 8211 and the rest of us 8211 deserve to have the facts laid out, the case against Wilson argued in a court of law? Undoubtedly, there will be such a case 8211 a federal case or a civil case, brought by the parents. But a grand jury indictment, even on a lesser charge like manslaughter, would have lent appropriate seriousness to a contested, foggy situation. It would have indicated, at the very least, that the evidence wasn   t dispositive and the situation required further public attention.<\/p>\n<p>Several things are absolutely clear, though. The authorities in Missouri, from Ferguson to St. Louis County to the governor   s office, have bungled this case from the start. That Michael Brown   s body was allowed to lie in the street for four hours is inexcusable. That crucial evidence 8211 Wilson   s gun 8211 was not dusted for prints is mystifying and incompetent. And then there was the Monday spectacle of a verdict reached, but not announced until after dark. Sheer idiocy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3603442\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>But there can no longer be a question that the initial accounts of the case were fraudulent. Michael Brown was not a gentle giant. He was not shot in the back. There was a scuffle of some sort between Brown and Wilson, perhaps with Brown trying to gain control of the police officer   s gun. There was, apparently, at least one shot fired at close range. Brown ran away, then turned and charged the officer.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3153340\/beyond-a-simple-solution-for-ferguson\/\" target=\"_blank\">Again, as I wrote a few weeks ago<\/a>, Wilson   s actions may have been justifiable under the law in Missouri, but he is not entirely exonerated: the death would have been preventable if he had been better trained. Still, you can   t indict Wilson for not abiding by training he didn   t receive. And you can   t elide the facts of the case. Wilson clearly panicked. He thought his life was in danger. He killed a young man. He should have to defend these actions publicly, under the fierce pressure of cross-examination.<\/p>\n<p>There will now be still more calls for a discussion about race in America. But that conversation can not simply be about white guilt or prejudice. The latter certainly does exist  it exists overwhelmingly, disgracefully. But the assumptions that lead police, and bodega owners, to racial profiling are real 8211 and those must be discussed, too. Liberals have avoided this conversation for 50 years, since crime rates exploded in the 1960s. And by doing so, they have done a real disservice to the disproportionate number of crime victims who are African-Americans, urban and poor. Poverty is no excuse for criminality. People who commit crimes are perpetrators, not victims. Indeed, blaming poverty for criminality is an insult to the vast majority of poor blacks who play by the rules 8211 graduate from high school or college, find a job, are responsible parents 8211 and have improved their lives as a result. As the President said, you can   t gainsay the fact that there has been enormous progress over the past 40 years&hellip with more to come, as a new generation of polychromatic, unprejudiced young people take charge.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3605266\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"2\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video- 08097837001-2\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-f7Ts\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\" 08097837001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<p>Back in the 1980s, my wife and I lived in a mostly-black neighborhood in New York. Our neighbors were placed in an impossible position: they were infuriated that many of the police who patrolled (or, more often, failed to patrol) our streets treated them as if they were criminals, but they also were terrified of, and infuriated by, the criminals who made it a life-threatening challenge to go down to the corner for a quart of milk. We had some real conversations in those days 8211 about crime, about the double-edged sword of affirmative action, about the hilariously stupid racial assumptions they encountered in the city. Some of our neighbors were public employees  others weren   t and were pissed off about the level of service they were receiving. There were intense conversations about whether it was  8220 racist 8221  to fire incompetents on the public payroll. I miss those conversations. They required a certain amount of candor and subtlety. They would have been impossible for ideologues, because the reality on our block defied any ideology. And they probably would have been impossible in public, since it was very hard for our neighbors to criticize young black men who had grown up in anger-infusing chaos.<\/p>\n<p>It is sad, but inevitable, that there will be two conversations about Ferguson. One will be public, one will be private. The public conversation will be dominated by rant, oversimplification and guilt-mongering. The private conversation will be unspeakable in segments of the white, Asian and Latino communities. If my experience in the 1980s is any guide, the conversations in the black community will be more reasonable, marked by anger, pain, embarrassment and the difficulties of dealing with kids like Michael Brown. It   s a national tragedy that we can   t seem to have that conversation in public, that political correctness stands directly athwart honesty in this republic of free speech.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Should the Ferguson Protestors Be TIME   s Person of the Year?

The site has had about 95,000 users since the second enrollment period began.<\/p>\n<p>The release of figures after the first week is a part of an Obama Administration effort to be more transparent about how many people are signing up for insurance via the health care marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>[<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vox.com\/2014\/11\/26\/7293429\/obamacare-enrollment-first-week\" target=\"_blank\">Vox<\/a>]<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Over%20450%2C000%20Have%20Signed%20Up%20for%20Health%20Insurance%20%7C%20TIME&body=Over%20450%2C000%20Have%20Signed%20Up%20for%20Health%20Insurance%0A%0ACompared%20to%20125%20last%20year%20this%20time%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3607727%2Fobamacare-enrollment-insurance%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3607727%2Fobamacare-enrollment-insurance%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f8x9&text=Obamacare%20signups%20over%20450%2C000%20after%20first%20week&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3607727%2Fobamacare-enrollment-insurance%2F&title=Over+450%2C000+Have+Signed+Up+for+Health+Insurance\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3607727\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3607727\/obamacare-enrollment-insurance\/\" data-title=\"Over 450,000 Have Signed Up for Health Insurance\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

She reportedly felt discomfort during exercise on Tuesday and was taken to MedStar Washington Hospital Center where a blockage was discovered.<\/p>\n<p>This is the latest health issue for Ginsburg, who was treated for cancer in 1999 and 2009. The justice has been called on to retire by many on the left who want her to give up her seat so President Obama can appoint a left-leaning successor, though with the Senate soon in Republican hands many think it   s likely too late.<\/p>\n<p>At any rate, Ginsburg isn   t planning on going anywhere soon.

Ross Barnett, who was in office from 1960 to 1964.<\/p>\n<p>The ruling was similar in Arkansas.<\/p>\n<p>The state   s marriage laws and the amendment violate the U.S. Constitution by  8220 precluding same-sex couples from exercising their fundamental right to marry in Arkansas, by not recognizing valid same-sex marriages from other states, and by discriminating on the basis of gender, 8221  Baker wrote.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3607158\"><\/div>\n<p>Baker put the ruling on hold, anticipating an appeal to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in St. Louis.<\/p>\n<p>A spokesman for Democratic Attorney General Dustin McDaniel said McDaniel was reviewing the ruling and would decide after the Thanksgiving holiday whether to appeal in consultation with Republican Attorney General-elect Leslie Rutledge in Arkansas.<\/p>\n<p>Mississippi officials had already said they planned to appeal any ruling that overturned the law.<\/p>\n<p>Judges across the country have ruled against bans similar to Arkansas    since the U.S. Supreme Court struck part of a federal anti-gay marriage law in June 2013, and gay marriage is legal in more than half of the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Jack Wagoner, a lawyer for the Arkansas couples who had told the judge last week that same-sex marriage would eventually be legal nationwide, said he was pleased with her decision.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 She   s on the right side of history, 8221  Wagoner said.  8220 It   s pretty clear where history   s heading on this issue. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>Another lawyer, Cheryl Maples, said eyes would turn now to the Arkansas Supreme Court, which heard arguments last week in a similar but separate case.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 If the state Supreme Court strikes down on state constitutional issues, then it   s gone as far as it can go, 8221  Maples said.<\/p>\n<p>Justices are weighing whether to uphold a decision in May striking down the 2004 amendment and earlier state law as unconstitutional. The decision led to 541 same sex couples getting married in the week before the state Supreme Court suspended his ruling.<\/p>\n<p>Justices have not indicated when they will rule in that case.<\/p>\n<p>Lawyers in McDaniel   s office had argued in federal court that same-sex marriage was not a fundamental right guaranteed by the constitution. McDaniel has said he personally supports allowing gay couples to marry but will stay in court defending the ban, which voters approved by a 3-1 margin.<\/p>\n<p>One of Mississippi   s plaintiff couples, Jocelyn  8220 Joce 8221  (JOH   -see) Pritchett and Carla Webb, live in Mississippi and married in Maine in 2013. Pritchett said Tuesday that she, Webb and their two young children were dancing around their living room after hearing about Reeves    ruling.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 If gay marriage can be legal in Mississippi, the whole country can feel hope, 8221  Pritchett said.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp <\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3607158\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Arkansas%2C%20Mississippi%20Gay%20Marriage%20Bans%20Overturned%20%7C%20TIME&body=Arkansas%2C%20Mississippi%20Gay%20Marriage%20Bans%20Overturned%0A%0ABoth%20states%20had%20voter-approved%20constitutional%20amendments%20pass%20in%202004%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3607158%2Farkansas-mississippi-gay-marriage-bans-overturned%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3607158%2Farkansas-mississippi-gay-marriage-bans-overturned%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f8nY&text=Arkansas%2C%20Mississippi%20Gay%20Marriage%20Bans%20Overturned&via=TIME\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3607158%2Farkansas-mississippi-gay-marriage-bans-overturned%2F&title=Arkansas%2C+Mississippi+Gay+Marriage+Bans+Overturned\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3607158\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3607158\/arkansas-mississippi-gay-marriage-bans-overturned\/\" data-title=\"Arkansas, Mississippi Gay Marriage Bans Overturned\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/","description":"The latest news and analysis on crime, religion, education, transportation, weather, immigration, sports, drugs, the law, and other news from around the nation"},"tags":"Arkansas|Gay Marriage|Marriage Equality|Mississippi","id":3607158,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3607158%2Farkansas-mississippi-gay-marriage-bans-overturned%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f8nY","encoded_title":"Arkansas%2C+Mississippi+Gay+Marriage+Bans+Overturned","twitter_text":"Arkansas%2C%20Mississippi%20Gay%20Marriage%20Bans%20Overturned","twitter_via":"TIME","subjects":[null],"ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"Arkansas, Mississippi Gay Marriage Bans Overturned"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"Arkansas, Mississippi Gay Marriage Bans Overturned"},"email_title":"Arkansas%2C%20Mississippi%20Gay%20Marriage%20Bans%20Overturned%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Arkansas%2C%20Mississippi%20Gay%20Marriage%20Bans%20Overturned%0A%0ABoth%20states%20had%20voter-approved%20constitutional%20amendments%20pass%20in%202004%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3607158%2Farkansas-mississippi-gay-marriage-bans-overturned%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-outbrain|rr-partner|rr-mag|rr-ad|rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3607158\/arkansas-mississippi-gay-marriage-bans-overturned\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3606492\/obama-ferguson-violence-grand-jury-announcement\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-f8de","title":"President Obama Says There Is    No Excuse    for Ferguson Violence","friendly_title":"President Obama Says There Is \u2018No Excuse\u2019 for Ferguson Violence","post_type":"post","available":true,"time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"President Obama Says There Is    No Excuse    for Ferguson Violence","excerpt":"Riots, looting and violent protests roiled the area Monday evening","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"Nov. 25, 2014","published":"2014-11-25 18:40:50","updated":"2014-11-25 23:40:50","minute":"6:40 pm","short":"11\/25"},"authors":[{"id":207012220,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/zeke-j-miller\/","name":"Zeke J Miller","bio":"Zeke Miller is a political reporter for TIME.
