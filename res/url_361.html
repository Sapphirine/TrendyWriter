And that 8217;s exactly what success looks like.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The comments came days after President Barack Obama set a tall order for the United States Wednesday in his address to the nation, pledging to &ldquo;degrade and ultimately destroy&rdquo; the militant group. But in public statements and closed-door comments, his administration is putting more emphasis on the first verb.<\/p>\n<p>For Obama, the risk is a familiar one: overpromising and under-delivering. In 2012, Obama set a &ldquo;red line&rdquo; in Syria, suggesting he&rsquo;d use airstrikes in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, a standard he repeatedly shifted throughout 2013.<\/p>\n<p>For months this summer, the Obama administration had set its goal on containing the threat of ISIS, but a combination of factors, including public outcry and congressional uproar over the brutal killing of two American journalists, has led the White House to escalate its rhetoric. But the harsher tone hasn&rsquo;t meant a change in the underlying aims.<\/p>\n<p>Obama first embraced the &ldquo;degrade and destroy&rdquo; formulation in a convoluted press conference in Estonia a day after ISIS released a video of the beheading of Steven Sotloff. But the operative lines were his admission that the group could never truly be eradicated. &ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve seen with al Qaeda, there are always going to be remnants that can cause havoc of any of these networks, in part because of the nature of terrorist activities,&rdquo; Obama said. &ldquo;You get a few individuals, and they may be able to carry out a terrorist act.&rdquo;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3373178\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

She says the relationship fell apart partly over disputes about setting a wedding date and how she did not  8220;want to continue in the category of mistress. 8221; Chapur disagreed with Sanford 8217;s explanation for their split and said that he should not &ldquo;leave blame on Jenny.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In 2009, Sanford 8217;s staff infamously claimed the politician, then South Carolina governor, was hiking the Appalachian trail when he went mysteriously absent from office. Sanford later admitted he was visiting Chapur in Argentina.<\/p>\n","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Hillary Clinton for her vote in favor of the 2002 Iraq War resolution, and in the general election, drew sharp contrast with Sen. John McCain over how to bring the war to an end.<\/p>\n<p>A senior administration official says the White House still supports repealing the 2002 law, and fully believes it can use the 2001 AUMF, passed after the attacks of September 11, 2001 to allow the U.S. to strike al Qaeda, to justify the strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. But the 2002 law would provide additional legal underpinning to strikes in Iraq&mdash;and even Syria&mdash;as scholars question the applicability of the 2001 authorization to ISIS, which publicly broke with al Qaeda in Iraq.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"> 8220;We believe that the President would have the statutory authority to conduct airstrikes against [ISIS] in Syria under the 2002 AUMF in at least some circumstances, 8221; the official said.<\/p>\n<p>For the opening stages of the American air campaign, the 160-strike effort largely restricted to humanitarian missions, and protecting American personnel and facilities, Obama relied on his Constitutional authority to protect the American people. Hours before Obama announced a broader campaign to  8220;degrade and ultimately destroy 8221; the Islamist militant group Wednesday, officials revealed that Obama would rely on the 2001 AUMF, which the administration had said previously it hopes to reign in.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, the senior administration official explained how the White House applies the 2001 law to ISIS:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">The 2001 AUMF authorizes the use of &ldquo;all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons&rdquo; responsible for 9\/11 and those who &ldquo;harbored such organizations or persons.&rdquo; The Administration has interpreted the 2001 AUMF to authorize the use of force against AQ, the Taliban, and associated forces. Based on ISIL&rsquo;s longstanding relationship with al-Qa&rsquo;ida (AQ) and Usama bin Laden; its long history of conducting, and continued desire to conduct, attacks against U.S. persons and interests, the extensive history of U.S. combat operations against ISIL dating back to the time the group first affiliated with AQ in 2004; and ISIL&rsquo;s position &ndash; supported by some individual members and factions of AQ-aligned groups &ndash; that it is the true inheritor of Usama bin Laden&rsquo;s legacy, the President may rely on the 2001 AUMF as statutory authority for the use of force against ISIL, notwithstanding the recent public split between AQ&rsquo;s senior leadership and ISIL.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3778771057001-1\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1m3YbA5\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3778771057001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3362683\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

I think  8216;war 8217; is the wrong reference term with respect to that, but obviously it involves kinetic military action. 8221; National Security Advisor Susan Rice weighed in Thursday to CNN that  8220;I think, frankly, this is a counterterrorism operation that will take time. 8221;<\/p>\n<p>But by Friday afternoon, the White House and the Pentagon were reversing course.  8220;Make no mistake, we know we are at war with [ISIS], in the same way we are at war, and continue to be at war, with al-Qaeda and its affiliates, 8221; Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said, referencing a long-term, largely-airborne campaign against the terrorist group.<\/p>\n<p>At the White House, the same word was used.  8220;The United States is at war with [ISIS] in the same way we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates, 8221; echoed White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest minutes later.  8220;The United States is at war with [ISIS]. 8221;<\/p>\n<p>Only Congress can formally declare war under the U.S. Constitution. The White House said Obama is now relying on the 2001 post-9\/11 Authorization for the Use of Military Force against al Qaeda as a Congressional justification for the campaign against ISIS.<\/p>\n<p>It was far from the first mixed message sent by the administration in the months-long conflict. Last month Obama suggested he had  8220;no strategy 8221; for dealing with ISIS in Syria. Later Obama suggested ISIS could be contained to become  8220;a manageable problem 8221; in the region. Finally, as he reiterated to the nation on Wednesday night, Obama promised to  8220;degrade and ultimately destroy 8221; the militant group, but he did not describe the metrics that would be used to know when either of those goals were achieved.<\/p>\n<p>The confusing language has drawn fire from Republicans and puzzling looks from Democrats, but hasn 8217;t yet undermined the emerging broad-based support among the American people for the airstrikes.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3341270\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Lipstadt makes far too little of the relationship between Israel&rsquo;s policies in the West Bank and Gaza and growing anti-Semitism in Europe and beyond. The trend to which she alludes parallels the carnage in Gaza over the last five years, not to mention the perpetually stalled peace talks and the continuing occupation of the West Bank. As hope for a two-state solution fades and Palestinian casualties continue to mount, the best antidote to anti-Semitism would be for Israel&rsquo;s patrons abroad to press the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for final-status resolution to the Palestinian question.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Within hours of the letter 8217;s publication, Shipman says, people on and off campus began calling for his ouster. Two weeks later, he resigned. Why this happened&mdash;and what 8217;s at stake&mdash;depends on who you ask.<\/p>\n<p>Shipman has a long history of sympathy for the plight of Palestinians. As a teenager, he lived in Egypt while his father worked for World Health Organization and was there when Israel invaded during the 1956 Suez War.  8220;Among my friends were Palestinian refugees and their children who were my age, so I heard their stories of dispossession and loss, people who had lost their homes and their farms and cut off from their land living in Jaffa and in the area which is now known as Israel, 8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>He has visited Israel and the Palestinian territories more than a dozen times. This spring, he took a group of Yale students on a spring trip to Bethlehem and Jerusalem.  8220;There is an apartheid situation there, 8221; he says.  8220;It is unpopular to say so, but it is the truth. 8221; His letter, he explains,  8220;suggested that in looking at the uptick in anti-Semitism in Europe and in the world, there is a correlation between the unresolved issues in Israel\/Palestine, the recent war in Gaza and the terrible damage incurred by that war, the awful civilian casualties, and all of this I believe has contributed to an uptick in anti-Semitic violence, 8221; he says.  8220;That is what I said, and that is what I meant. 8221;<\/p>\n<p>Many people swiftly pounced. Yale pointed out that Shipman was not on staff but was rather employed by the Episcopal Church. Chabad at Yale, a Jewish student group, issued this statement:  8220;Reverend Bruce Shipman&rsquo;s justification of anti-semitism by blaming it on Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza is frankly quite disturbing. His argument attempts to justify racism and hate of innocent people, in Israel and around the world. 8221;<\/p>\n<p>Religion columnist and Yale lecturer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tabletmag.com\/scroll\/183402\/the-yale-chaplain-who-doesnt-get-jews\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Oppenheimer<\/a> wrote that Shipman 8217;s approach  8220;gives license to all sorts of stereotyping, racism, and prejudice. . . . why wouldn&rsquo;t one write,  8216;The best antidote to stop-and-frisk policing would be for black men everywhere to press other black men to stop shooting each other 8217;? Why wouldn&rsquo;t one write&mdash;perhaps after a Muslim was beaten up by white-supremacist thugs&mdash; 8217;The best antidote to Islamophobia would be for radical Islam&rsquo;s patrons abroad to press ISIS and Al Qaeda to just cut it out 8217;? 8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/volokh-conspiracy\/wp\/2014\/08\/26\/episcopal-chaplain-at-yale-jews-are-to-blame-for-anti-semitism-for-not-making-peace-with-genocidal-enemy\/\" target=\"_blank\">David Bernstein wrote for the Washington Post<\/a>,  8220;Next on Rev. Shipman&rsquo;s bucket list: blaming women who dress provocatively for rape, blaming blacks for racism because of high crime rates, and blaming gays for homophobia for being  8216;flamboyant.' 8221;<\/p>\n<p>The official reason for Shipman 8217;s resignation, according to the Episcopal Church at Yale, was not the letter but  8220;dynamics between the Board of Governors and the Priest-in-Charge. 8221; Ian Douglas, bishop of Connecticut and president of the board of governors for the Episcopal Church at Yale, emphasized this distinction to<a href=\"http:\/\/yaledailynews.com\/blog\/2014\/09\/09\/amidst-controversy-university-reverend-resigns\/\" target=\"_blank\"> the Yale Daily News<\/a>.  8220;It&rsquo;s not as glamorous a story to hear that Priest-in-Charge Bruce Shipman resigned because of institutional dynamics within the Episcopal Church at Yale and not the debates related to Israel and Palestine &mdash; but it&rsquo;s the truth, 8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Shipman disagrees.  8220;This story cannot be simply dismissed as the inner problems of the Episcopal Church at Yale. It was not, 8221; he says.  8220;It was this letter that set off the firestorm. 8221;<\/p>\n<p>For Shipman, the controversy raises a number of  8220;troubling questions 8221; about free speech on campus. In addition to the hate mail, Shipman says he has also received letters of support from people thanking him for taking a courageous stand for Palestinian rights. University chaplains, he adds, have a long history advocating unpopular cultural positions. William Sloane Coffin Jr., a chaplain at Yale during the 1960s, gained fame for practicing civil disobedience in prostest of the U.S. war in Vietnam. Clergy today, he continues, need to know what protections they do and don 8217;t have when it comes to taking unpopular positions.  8220;I think of abolitionism and the role the church played in that, I think of the civil rights movement, I think of the anti-war movement and the role the chaplains played in that, often incurring the wrath of big givers and donors of the university, but they were protected and they were respected, 8221; he says.  8220;That seems not to be the case now. 8221;<\/p>\n<p>As to what 8217;s next for him, Shipman isn 8217;t yet sure, but he doesn 8217;t plan on remaining silent.  8220;I think the truth must be brought out and it must be discussed on campus by people of goodwill without labeling anti-Semitic anyone who raises these questions, 8221; he says.  8220;Surely this debate should take place on the campuses of the leading universities across the country. If not there, where? 8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3340634\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

That blows away the field: Vice President Joe Biden comes in a distant second with 15%, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has said repeatedly she won&rsquo;t run, gets 7%, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has 5%, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo 3%, Maryland Gov. Martin O&rsquo;Malley 2% and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick 1%.<\/p>\n<p>And one of the biggest differences between 2007 and now is that at that Steak Fry, which is an annual fundraiser, then Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards were eagerly anticipated guests in attendance. Ultimately, Obama would win the caucuses and Edwards would come in second. This time, there&rsquo;s no rival in sight. Well, Sanders may show up (he&rsquo;s holding an event in Des Moines that night), but few believe he&rsquo;s a threat to Clinton the way Obama and Edwards were.<\/p>\n<p>That said, many Iowans view Clinton&rsquo;s candidacy with a grain of salt, and some will come to the Steak Fry to see how she behaves. She ran a decidedly non-retail campaign in 2008, visiting less than 60 of the 99 counties. Bill Clinton didn&rsquo;t contest Iowa in 1992 as his host, Harkin, was on the ballot and an easy shoo-in. And he didn&rsquo;t bother much with it during his reelection. Which means that Iowans feel like they don&rsquo;t truly know the Clintons they way they know other politicians who&rsquo;ve come to pay homage to the fickle first voters. And they&rsquo;ll expect&mdash;or at least hope for&mdash;some signs of courtship from the Clintons.<\/p>\n<p>Officially, Clinton isn 8217;t running for President. She said last week that she 8217;d make up her mind after Jan. 1 if she 8217;ll enter the race. But that won 8217;t stop speculation from running rampant. Let the pseudo-shadow-non-campaigning begin.<\/p>\n","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Why does Turkey feel they don't need to be apart of the fight against ISIS when they have been one of the countries leading the charge against Assad and support of rebels in the Syrian civil war?<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello and thanks for the question. I am actually in Ankara right now with Secretary of State John Kerry, who has come here for meetings on this issue. This is a delicate situation for Turkey. You may also have noticed that Turkey attended the Gulf Cooperation Council meeting led by John Kerry in Jeddah yesterday &mdash; but that it did not sign the group&rsquo;s communiqu&eacute; pledging a unified effort against ISIS. Administration officials insist that Turkey is helping, although they&rsquo;d like to see more progress. Why so delicate? Primarily because ISIS is holding 49 Turkish diplomats and security officers hostage &mdash; all captured the group captured the Iraqi city of Mosul and overran the Turkish consulate there in June. The Turks are obviously hope to get the hostages back alive and are trying not to provoke ISIS in a way that might lead to their harm. Officials say that Turkey has taken steps to stop foreign fighters from flying into the country and crossing the border into Syria. Six thousand have been denied entry to the country and another thousand have been deported, according to a State Department official. But Washington wants to see more progress on that front. The U.S. is also asking Turkey to crack down on ISIS oil smuggling over its borders which is bringing the group significant revenue. How much the hostage situation will complicate those efforts remains to be seen. In fact, just as I was about to send this, John Kerry visited the press here to make a statement. He is standing ten feet away from me now, declaring that &ldquo;Turkey and the United States will stand together against any challenges within the region &mdash; including all terrorism.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>deconstructiva asks, Michael, do you see Kurdistan going independent soon? (I asked Jay Newton-Small a similar question during her Q+A, now it's your turn!) I think they will thanks to growing differences with Iraq and better relations with Turkey, not to mention their oil. It is interesting that oil can play a key role in a region's potential independence, in this case for both Kurdistan and Scotland.<\/p><\/b>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

And that 8217;s exactly what success looks like.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The comments came days after President Barack Obama set a tall order for the United States Wednesday in his address to the nation, pledging to &ldquo;degrade and ultimately destroy&rdquo; the militant group. But in public statements and closed-door comments, his administration is putting more emphasis on the first verb.<\/p>\n<p>For Obama, the risk is a familiar one: overpromising and under-delivering. In 2012, Obama set a &ldquo;red line&rdquo; in Syria, suggesting he&rsquo;d use airstrikes in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, a standard he repeatedly shifted throughout 2013.<\/p>\n<p>For months this summer, the Obama administration had set its goal on containing the threat of ISIS, but a combination of factors, including public outcry and congressional uproar over the brutal killing of two American journalists, has led the White House to escalate its rhetoric. But the harsher tone hasn&rsquo;t meant a change in the underlying aims.<\/p>\n<p>Obama first embraced the &ldquo;degrade and destroy&rdquo; formulation in a convoluted press conference in Estonia a day after ISIS released a video of the beheading of Steven Sotloff. But the operative lines were his admission that the group could never truly be eradicated. &ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve seen with al Qaeda, there are always going to be remnants that can cause havoc of any of these networks, in part because of the nature of terrorist activities,&rdquo; Obama said. &ldquo;You get a few individuals, and they may be able to carry out a terrorist act.&rdquo;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3373178\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Bend your elbows straight back and squeeze your upper outer arms (or place your knees in your armpits), engage your core, and lift your feet up off the floor. When you take flight, you automatically lift your spirits. Try to hold for 5 breaths and come down to rest when you need.
