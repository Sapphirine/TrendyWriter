In advance of the president's big speech tonight, probably wise to get a good lay of the land among the Villagers. Having watched the shows today briefly, I think Ron Fournier's sage advice is fairly <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/10/d_c_s_most_ridiculous_pundit_does_it_again_ron_fournier_pretends_to_be_serious_is_really_a_troll/">representative:</a></div>
<blockquote>
We’re angry and scared now. We want to fight. History suggests that we will rally behind the commander in chief in the immediate aftermath of tonight’s address. But it wasn’t that long ago—a matter of weeks, really—when “war-weary” was the go-to adjective for “Americans.” We will grow weary again, and Obama may need to draw on tonight’s speech to remind people, <i>“This is why we must fight.”</i></blockquote>
That pretty much sums it up: We must fight! To hell with all that pansy strategy talk, the president has to be a decider and accomplish the mission, whatever it is, and dammit we have to stick with it forever! Fight, fight, fight. &nbsp;(He's right that the people will likely rally --- the propaganda from all sides has done its work.)<br />
<br />
Andrew Sullivan is one of the few people who has revisited his support for Bush's warmongering and is much more skeptical this time.  He provides us with an excellent round-up of opinion that's just a teensy bit more nuanced than what we are seeing on cable news right now or from Fournier above. I'm going to pick off a few of them but I highly recommend that you read the whole post and follow the links if you're looking for real information.  <a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/09/10/obamas-isis-gamble/">He titles the post Obama's open-ended, reckless ISIS gamble:</a><br />

Obama discussed his plans at a dinner with a bipartisan group of foreign policy experts this week at the White House and made clear his belief that he has the authority to attack the militant Islamist group on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border to protect U.S national security, multiple people who participated in the discussion said. The move to attack in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syrias-assad-thinks-he-is-winning-he-could-be-wrong/2014/09/08/09c5044e-a6ca-45d0-91a8-c9eacd4c92f8_story.html" style="color: #2a5db0; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;" target="_blank">Syria</a>&nbsp;would represent a remarkable escalation in strategy for Obama, who has sought during his presidency to reduce the U.S. military engagement in the Middle East.<span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></blockquote>

I guess entering one failed state’s civil war wasn’t challenging enough! Let’s enter two while we’re at it. Exit strategy? Pshaw. That’ll be up to Obama’s successor.

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
A strategy predicated on the existence of an effective moderate Syrian rebel force is doomed to fail. Instead, the focus should be on shaping the environment in ways which will encourage the emergence of a politically legitimate and more effectively unified opposition. The destructive and radicalizing effects of uncoordinated flows of aid to competing rebel groups from outside states and private actors have long been obvious. The emerging regional strategy offers perhaps the first opportunity to unify these efforts to build rather than divide the Syrian opposition. The new coalition should expand on efforts to shut off funding and support not only for ISIS but also for the other powerful Islamist trends within the Syrian rebellion.<span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
This will take time. The immediate goal in Syria should be the securing of a strategic pause between the rebel forces and the regime in order to focus military efforts on ISIS. Crucially, this strategic pause does not mean cooperation or alignment with Asad, or a retreat from the Geneva Accord principles of a political transition. It should be understood instead as buying the time to shape an environment in which such a transition could become plausible. … The longer-term goal should be to translate this anti-ISIS tacit accord into an effective agreement by the external backers of both Asad and the rebels on a de-escalation of the conflict. Rather than a military drive on Damascus, the international community should support the delivery of serious humanitarian relief, security and governance to rebel controlled areas and refugees.</blockquote>

Obama appears to envisage arming and training the “moderates” of the Free Syrian Army, who have consistently been pushed to the margins by al-Qaeda offshoots and affiliates. Private billionaires in the Gulf will continue to support ISIL or its rival, Jabhat al-Nusra (the Succor Front, which has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda).<span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></blockquote>

Strengthening yet another guerrilla group will, again, likely prolong the fighting. Moreover, in the past two years, Free Syrian Army moderate groups have gone radical and joined Nusrah or ISIL at an alarming rate. Defectors or defeated groups from the FSA will take their skills and arms with them into the al-Qaeda offshoots.<span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></blockquote>

In Iraq, while giving the Kurds and the Iraqi army close air support against ISIL has already borne fruit when the local forces were defending their ethnic enclaves, it hasn’t helped either largely Kurdish forces or the (largely Shiite) Iraqi army take Sunni Arab territory. Several campaigns against Tikrit have failed. The only thing worse than this failure might be success. Success would mean smart phone video making its way to YouTube showing US bombing urban residential buildings full of Sunni Arab families in support for a motley crew of Kurdish (non-Arab) fighters and Shiite troops and militiamen. Helping such forces take Tikrit, the birthplace of Saddam Hussein, would make for a very bad image in the Sunni world.</blockquote>

But we never learn, do we?

<blockquote>
For the United States, the best possible outcome would be for the militants to withdraw from their illusory state in Iraq to bases in Syria, where they might wither in the face of strengthened Syrian rebels; ideally, the rebels would also bring an end to the Assad regime in Damascus. Iraq and Syria, with their multicultural societies, would then have breathing room to incubate inclusive governments. That’s the goal, anyway. The worst outcome would be another open-ended, treasury-sapping, coffin-producing, and increasingly unpopular war that fails to erase ISIS or resurrect Iraq. It might even, in time, become a symbolic graveyard of American greatness—as it was for the French and the British. The Middle East has a proven record of sucking us in and spitting us out<span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></blockquote>

Maybe it will take another humiliating, devastating defeat in an unwinnable war to finally get Americans to understand the limits of their military power – and the increasing toxicity of the American brand.</blockquote>

Sullivan places his hopes in a spirited Senate debate,. &nbsp;I hope there is one but I seriously doubt it will make any difference. Once this train picks up speed there never any stopping it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
I must also say that I'm more sympathetic to the President here than some. I think he has resisted the pull of the bipartisan foreign policy national security establishment more than any president I can remember. That is not nothing. The Deep State is what really runs the world and it gets what it wants.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I see this, by the way, in contrast to the domestic economic establishment which is certainly run by elites, some of the same ones, but where I think the president actually has more room to move the dial. &nbsp;The executive branch actually does run the agencies and the people are far less easily manipulated. (See: social security cuts and grand bargains.) But on national security all it takes is some hysteria from Lindsay Graham, a couple of scary videos and a good dollop of "America-Fuck Yeah!" and the public is on board with some super-power ultra-violence (aimed at faceless foreigners, of course.) If it suits the national security establishment to unleash that beast the president doesn't have much power to stop it, "commander-in-chief" be damned.&nbsp;</div>

He gave it the &nbsp;good-old college try though, I'll give him that. The good news is that he's unlikely to pump his fist and say "feel's good!" before his speech tonight. &nbsp;Not that it matters.<br />

If you would like to see the true success of the anti-abortion zealots just <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/10/gofundme_bans_all_content_relating_to_abortion_but_leaves_antiabortion_campaigns_active/">get a load of this:</a><br />
<br />
<blockquote>Last week, crowdfunding platform GoFundMe pulled a campaign to raise money for an Illinois woman’s abortion. In a message to the woman, identified only as Bailey, GoFundMe said that the fundraiser was not “appropriate” for the site because it contained “subject matter that GoFundMe would rather not be associated with.” In an earlier comment to Salon on its decision to shutdown the campaign, a “customer happiness” representative said that each review is handled on a “case-by-case basis” and, “In this particular case, GoFundMe determined that the fundraising campaign titled ‘Bailey’s Abortion Fund’ would be removed from the site.”<br />
<br />
But as of this week, the site will no longer handle campaigns to fund abortion on a case-by-case basis. According to GoFundMe’s updated guidelines (“What’s Not Allowed on GoFundMe“), abortion fundraisers are banned without exception. In addition to prohibiting crowdfunded abortion campaigns, “content associated with or relating to” abortion is also banned. This information is listed under the headline, “Termination of Life,” which is the same language used by antiabortion activists who believe in fetal personhood. (The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists defines abortion as “a procedure that is done to end a pregnancy.”) In fact, GoFundMe has a separate section outlining which medical campaigns are prohibited, but abortion is not listed in it.<br />
<br />
But the ban on abortion-related content has not been neutrally applied. As of Wednesday afternoon, there are still pages of antiabortion campaigns active on the site. It seems that you can’t use GoFundMe to raise money for anything related to abortion — unless you’re campaigning to ban abortion.<br />
<br />
One campaign that raised $1,510 of its $1,700 goal described its mission as “Advocating for Women & Girls at the UN,” and informed potential donors, “Your donation will help spread the word of more atrocities that take place in American abortion clinics.”</blockquote><br />
This is not all that unusual.  Advocating for reproductive rights is "controversial."  Advocating for "life" isn't.  That's one of the big success stories of the past couple of decades of movement conservatism. <br />
<br />
This is a battle that people are sick of fighting, I get that.  Why won't women just figure this out and move on already?  But this is an issue that personally affects the freedom of half the population of the planet and indirectly impacts everyone. It's as fundamental to human agency in this life as it gets. And those who want to restrict that agency and limit the choices and ultimate freedom of women are not losing the battle.  They're winning it. One baby step at a time. <br />

Why should <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/massachusetts-mayor-threat-gun">this</a> be a problem?  According to the gun proliferation advocates carrying a gun is a perfectly normal thing to do and nobody should feel that it's being used as a form of intimidation, especially not in a political sense:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>[Councilman] Carreia signed the petition filed by town residents to recall the mayor [Flanagan] over tax hikes and garbage fees. Flanagan, who has challenged the petition's validity, allegedly asked Carreia to call the Fall River Herald News and say he was intimidated into signing the recall petition.<br />
<br />
According to Carreia, Flanagan took a gun out of the center console in the SUV and told the councilman that he never leaves home without his firearm.<br />
<br />
"Obviously when he took out a gun, the whole thing escalated," Carreia told the Boston Herald on Monday. "This is the mayor. I don’t know what he’s capable of. He didn’t forewarn me he had a gun. I thought, ‘This is ridiculous. This is crazy.’ There’s no doubt in my mind there was intimidation being used. No doubt."<br />
<br />
However, Flanagan said that the gun was in his waistband and that he never took it out. He claims he only showed Carreia the gun and was trying to show Carreia how to protect himself.</blockquote><br />
That's right.  He was just showing him his gun and giving him some "instruction" on how one might protect ones self.  Just like those nice "good guys" who carry guns into stores and restaurants aren't in any way intimidating people.  They're just exercising their right to bear arms --- and if you happen to feel intimidated by that, well, that's your problem. <br />
<br />
<i>Nice little free speech you've got there ... be a shame if anything happened to it.</i><br />

<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show">On the necessity of having a congressional debate on ISIS strategy</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>We have a great and recent history of making terrible decisions. Terrible, short-sighted, poorly argued and in some cases based on false premises decisions."</blockquote><br />
Also too, this:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Yes, some of the U.S. aircraft that are conducting these now 153 airstrikes are drones, so there is no pilot at risk, the the other aircraft that we've got over there are fighter jets and what they describe as attack aircraft. All of those have pilots and crews. And for some reason we've decided not to call what they're doing "combat." But the people they are attacking have some capacity to shoot down aircraft that are attacking them. They've got heavy anti-aircraft weapons. <br />
<br />
So it might be politically convenient to say you support airstrikes, but not combat, or airstrikes but not "boots-on-the-ground. But there are now more than 1100 U.S. personnel in Iraq to support the airstrikes that are already happening. And god forbid if American aircraft start getting shot down by this militant group with their anti-aircraft artillery, then you better believe there are going to be boots on the grounds, and quickly...</blockquote><br />
Her whole segment is worth watching. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there is almost no chance that the congress would not approve military action against the barbaric monsters who beheaded two Americans. The president is out there saying that he's going whether they like it or not which may just be enough to taunt them into doing it --- especially since the polling makes it clear that the American people back the play.<br />
<br />
So I think the "Kingston" strategy of forcing the president to make the decision so they can criticize him either way may no longer be operative. It's always possible that they can delay action until the election but if history informs us of anything, a call to arms will almost always be met with enthusiastic support among most politicians trying to be re-elected.<br />
<br />
But the debate is still worth having.It tends to clarify things.  And politicians <i>should</i> be on the record when it comes to war. I just wouldn't get my hopes up that it will change anything,.<br />

The political world is abuzz with the news that the upstart Zephyr Teachout campaign made a much more serious run at Andrew Cuomo last night than anyone anticipated. For a campaign with no money in the most expensive market in the nation, it's quite an achievement. Blue America is proud to have been among those who endorsed her.<br />
<br />
Matt Stoller has <a href="https://medium.com/@matthewstoller/5-reasons-for-the-zephyr-teachout-phenomenon-and-5-reasons-andrew-cuomo-will-still-be-governor-8eeb3fc1ec22">a good piece</a> up this morning with five reasons why Cuomo won anyway and it tells you a lot about American politics. (For instance, he points out that the entire "liberal" establishment went for Cuomo and Hochul.) But he also made some important points about why this campaign has stimulated such interest among liberals.  This one strikes me as particularly salient:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
This was a real debate of ideas. This was the most interesting election I’ve seen since 2006, when Ned Lamont challenged Joe Lieberman for the Senate seat. Lamont defeated Lieberman in the primary, but lost in the general election. That year, the Presidential candidates — Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, and Barack Obama — saw that the anti-Bush left that had emerged in the wake of the Iraq war to challenge the pro-war hawks was not dominant in the party, and resolved to crush it. They did. There has been such intra-party agreement for the past six years over policy that Paul Krugman and Matt Yglesias both pronounced the party devoid of real debate, except over some minor details (Vox’s headline was “7 reasons the Democratic coalition is more united than ever”). This election, in 2014, is the first signal that there’s real dissent within the party, over big stuff. While the core disagreements incorporate economic justice as well as national security, it’s not a coincidence that Zephyr Teachout was the internet director of Howard Dean’s campaign in 2003–2004.</blockquote>
I think this is right.  But I'd add that all the forces for the status quo are gathering their strength to marginalize it. The Very Serious People (with money) are hashing out the situation and will decide that this actually strengthens Cuomo's hands with people who matter --- conservatives. They will see him as a good leader now. Sure, a bunch of hippies voted against him which means he must be doing something right. "This is a conservative country."  Watch. <br />
<br />
Not that it matters --- we must forge ahead. Liberals in this country have the same right to representation as conservatives do. And all Americans deserve a debate about the great issues of our time. Hopefully this is the start of something big. <br />
<br />

			<p><b>Math is hard</b></p>

<p>by Tom Sullivan</p><p>

North Carolina's Republican House Speaker, Thom Tillis, wants to be the state's next U.S. senator. He's finding it a tough sell. Tea party members and Republican small businessmen oppose Tillis for pushing for <a href="http://www.citizen-times.com/story/opinion/contributors/2014/08/22/thom-tillis-constituents-way-highway/14451859/">toll lanes on I-77</a> in his own district and elsewhere in the state. Then, someone <a href="http://www.citizen-times.com/story/opinion/contributors/2014/08/12/got-wrong-drones/13953945/">anonymously</a> slipped a provision into a must-pass budget bill that "allows warrantless drone surveillance at all public events ... or any place which is in 'plain view' of a law enforcement officer." Privacy advocates from left to <a href="http://dailyhaymaker.com/?p=8851">right</a> cried foul.</p><p> 

Next, Tillis was been pilloried for "<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/2014-north-carolina-elections-thom-tillis-kay-hagan-110686.html">mansplaining</a>" both in his debate with incumbent Democrat Sen. Kay Hagan and in a TV ad where he uses "simple math" (just numbers on a white board) to show how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHIuN0b0QzA">math is lost</a> on Hagan. The Tillis ad spotlights the average 7% raise he claims state teachers received under his leadership (only after the loud public outcry over Republican education cuts in an election year). Well, <a href="http://www.wral.com/pay-raise-claims-confuse-frustrate-teachers/13961974/">not so fast</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>When Gov. Pat McCrory wrote to welcome teachers back to the classroom, he touted a "substantial" pay raise that amounted to "an average pay increase of 5.5 percent for teachers."</p><p>

That might have been exciting news, except that legislative leaders have been touting a 7 percent average pay raise for more than a month. House Speaker Thom Tillis trumpets that 7 percent figure as "simple math" in a recent campaign ad for his U.S. Senate campaign.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VoByiXfzDUI/VA_L3afYEHI/AAAAAAAAAUg/wrTcBiKX6ZM/s1600/McCroryCapture.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VoByiXfzDUI/VA_L3afYEHI/AAAAAAAAAUg/wrTcBiKX6ZM/s400/McCroryCapture.JPG" /></a></div></blockquote><p>I guess math is hard for Pat and Thom.</p><br>

<a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/wsj-nbc-poll-finds-that-almost-two-thirds-of-americans-back-attacking-militants-1410301920">This is working out just great.</a>  I wrote the other day that I felt that people were looking for some action and it appears my instincts were on target:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>In moving cautiously to date, Mr. Obama may have underestimated the public's appetite for military action—especially after the beheading of two American journalists.<br />
<br />
The poll found that 61% saw it in the nation's interest to attack ISIS. Last year, after Mr. Obama accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons, only 21% said it was in the U.S. interest to take military action.<br />
<br />
The president has "a country and an electorate, regardless of party, who seems to be ready to take the next step," said Fred Yang, a Democratic pollster who conducted the survey with GOP pollster Bill McInturff. That could give Mr. Obama may have a chance to reassert himself as a leader, pollsters said.<br />
<br />
"The president seems to be controlled by events and not leading events," said Mr. McInturff. But with the public so ready to take military action against ISIS, he said, "it might allow him to perhaps use September and October to be a more strongly perceived figure than he's been."<br />
<br />
In recent months, domestic issues have been overshadowed by crises across the globe—especially the rapid advance of Islamic State in Iraq. Mr. Obama has launched airstrikes to protect U.S. interests but has been criticized for not acting more quickly and decisively—a critique fueled last week when he said, "We have no strategy yet."<br />
<br />
Moreover, Mr. Obama has presided over a significant decline in confidence in U.S. security: The poll found that 47% believe the country is less safe than it was before the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks—up sharply from 28% just one year ago.<br />
<br />
The survey was taken Sept. 3-7, just after the beheading by ISIS of a second U.S. journalist. While those surveyed weren't asked directly about that event, the poll found that 94% had heard news of the two murders, a higher level of public attention than given to any of 22 news events the Journal/NBC News survey has tested since 2009.<br />
<br />
The news, in some cases, turned doves into hawks. "Come on! They are rounding up people and just killing them," said Sara Appleton, 31, a Democrat in Austin who opposed the Iraq war and voted twice for Mr. Obama. "I think we should have intervened earlier."</blockquote><br />
People are in the mood to kick some ass and take some names. After all, the economy still sucks and there doesn't seem to be any hope of sharp improvement any time soon. Why not get involved in Iraq again?  It worked so well the first time:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Strobe Talbott, a deputy secretary of State during the Clinton administration and now president of the Brookings Institution think tank, said he left the dinner with the sense that the president is convinced the U.S. and its allies need a comprehensive approach to destroy the extremist group.<br />
<br />
"This is not a matter of containment," Mr. Talbott said. "This is not about keeping ISIS from expanding, it is about a takedown."</blockquote><br />
America, fuck yeah! <br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, the poll also says that Republicans now have a 10 point advantage on the economy. Maybe we can finally stop raising that debt ceiling and and get to cutting ourselves some social security, amirite?? <br />

<blockquote>
“Duck Dynasty” star Willie Robertson has a new tactic to changing the minds of non-believers: Nicolas Cages’s new movie “Left Behind.”<br />
<br />
Robertson stars in a promotional video urging Christians to take their non-believing friends and family to see the flick, which is based on a popular end times book-series.<br />
<br />
“Like most Christians, my family and I can truly say that we’re excited about the soon return of Jesus,” Robertson says in the video. “And I’m sure, if you’ve been watching the news lately, you know that that return could be any day from now.”<br />
<br />
“But what about those who may not even know about it?” Robertson worries. “People who don’t even know what’s at stake?”<br />
<br />
Take then to see this film, and naturally they’ll convert and be a-OK.<br />
<br />
It’s a warning to those, if it happened today, they’d be left behind,” Robertson explains of the action-packed film. “And I believe people are going to make that life-changing decision to follow Christ on the way home from the theater on Oct. 3.”</blockquote>

This is too important to get this bogged down in a Congressional debate if the president does not believe the support is there.<br />
<br />
If it is there, ideally he should get it. But I believe as commander-in-chief he is the absolute power to carry out these attacks.</blockquote>
Now, that tyrannical use of executive orders to delay some Obamacare regulations? &nbsp;<i>That will not stand.</i>  War? Who wants to vote for war?  It's risky. As Kingston says, let the president take the heat and if it goes bad, then you can blame him for it. Then it's all good<br />

<a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/die-hard-director-john-mctiernan-683407">From last February:</a><br />
<blockquote>
Movie director John McTiernan was released from the minimum-security Federal Prison Camp in Yankton, S.D., Tuesday morning after 328 days of incarceration.<br />
<br />
The director of hit films including Predator, Die Hard and The Hunt for Red October served a sentence related to allegations he made false statements to an FBI agent about the number of times he hired private investigator Anthony Pellicano -- who remains in prison.</blockquote>
I didn't followed the case so I don't know whether some kinds of punishment was justified but considering the huge lies we are told daily by our government police agencies, this does seem excessive. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McTiernan">If Wikipedia is to be believed</a>, it's abuse of prosecutorial discretion and possible political persecution.)<br />
<br />
But that's not why I bring this up. I bring it up because of <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/die-hard-director-john-mctiernan-731171">the speech McTiernan just made </a>at the Deauville Film festival. &nbsp;He had a different one planned but threw it away and said this instead:<br />
<blockquote>
I can only plead with you to examine the current political and cultural works of my country [the U.S.]. We are in the hands of a terrible counterrevolution and a great reaction, a second Civil War sponsored by the same people that lost the first Civil War," the director said.<br />
<br />
"And it has created a good president who is a prisoner of the White House who can do little beyond the ceremonial," McTiernan continued. "It has made, despite of what you may see on screens, a prison country, and I've had the pleasure of seeing what most people in our class are never allowed to see. I've seen the engine of the beast, it has given us a country with more prisoners than North Korea per capita, more policemen per capita than Germany in 1938. They have suspended trial by jury in most of America."<br />
<br />
He also contended that the U.S. sends 750,000 people per year to prison, and that cumulatively over the last two decades 15 percent of the adult population have been incarcerated. "All are predominantly poor white, poor brown and poor black people. And that is the point," McTiernan said. "That is the engine of the machine; because these people forever are disenfranchised, they can never vote. Taking 15 percent of the electorate out of the electorate is enough to control anything." Applause followed those remarks.<br />
<br />
The purpose of the mass incarceration is the transfer of wealth, he said, noting: "They have transferred approximately one-third of the wealth of the country from the middle class and the poor not to the top one percent, but to one-tenth of one percent."</blockquote>
He said this to a bunch of cheese eating surrender monkeys which should result in Fox News viewers rushing to burn their VHS copies of <i>Die Hard</i>. (They'll be very flammable --- they never opened the box-set their kids gave them for Christmas because they couldn't get the damned VCR to work ...) <br />
<br />
It's a very neat formulation for what we are seeing with all the inequality and the prisons and the militarization and proliferation of police agencies at all levels of government. Maybe too neat.  But there is more than a grain of truth in what he said. <br />

			<b>Government bureaucrats just playing with our minds</b><br />

<br />
It's sad that climate change has become an ideological issue but unfortunately it has. Hardcore conservatives reject the science because they just reject science. Always have. It inconveniently interferes with their superstitions and traditions. Libertarians have other reasons for rejecting it --- it interferes with John Galt's ability to make billions. So they have convince themselves that all the scientists are refusing to consider all the evidence because Big Government indirectly pays their salaries so they have made a corrupt bargain with the bureaucrats. Seriously.<br />
<br />
This is from the vaunted Cato Institute:<br />
<blockquote>
In our post last week titled “Climate Alarmism: When is this Bozo Going Down?” we described how new research increasingly casts doubt on the validity of climate models and their projections of future climate change.  It is increasing clear that climate models simply predict too much warming from human greenhouse gas emissions. <br />
<br />
But the scientific community, or at least that part of it which makes its living off climate alarm, is slow to accept this.<br />
<br />
Who can blame these folks?  More money flows from the government into universities (or government labs) to study the effects of climate change if we all agree that human greenhouse gas emissions are leading to climate change of a dangerous magnitude.<br />
<br />
So it is left to the emeritus or retired profs to lay bare the truth.</blockquote>
<br />
So it's only the retired professors who are sounding the alarm about the climate change "hoax"? I don't think so. I'm fairly sure there's another group that's pretty invested, so to speak, in creating "controversy" about climate change. Oddly they go unmentioned in this story:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/IaKm89eVhoE" width="560"></iframe></blockquote>
<br />
<a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/global-warming-and-energy/polluterwatch/koch-industries/state-policy-network-spn/?__utma=1.834972712.1309880319.1345044157.1345047894.336&amp;__utmb=1.6.10.1345047894&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1345047894.336.247.utmcsr=google|utmccn=%28organic%29|utmcmd=organic|utmctr=%28not%20provided%29&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=19481784">Also too, this.</a><br />
<br />
It's always interesting to see how progressive memes are repurposed for conservative ends.  (The populist strain, for instance, is often turned inside out by right wingers inverting the argument against the wealthy and applying them to "greedy" union members.)  This is another example of how the obvious corruption of the energy industries financing anti-climate change pseudo-science is changed to corruption of scientists whose universities get funding from the government.  <br />
<br />
It's obvious why energy companies would want to create the impression that there is controversy about the science. They stand to lose money if anyone ever decides to do something about this.  But the question that goes unanswered is why government bureaucrats would want to perpetrate this hoax? What are <i>they</i> getting out of it? Just their jollies, I guess.<br />
<br />
There's no good reason for government to <i>want</i> to hype climate change --- it's a nearly insurmountable challenge that is going to cause massive upheaval and human misery. &nbsp;I guess if you believe that's what government is all about, this might make some sense. &nbsp;Otherwise it's just silly.<br />

<br />
It's truly disturbing to see the many grotesque reactions to the Ray Rice video and just as disturbing to see the reactions to his wife's statement about it. &nbsp;Ugh. Once again we see that too many people cannot tell the difference between words and violence. &nbsp;Apparently nobody ever told them the old saying about sticks and stones and breaking bones when they were children.<br />
<br />
But it's also sad that so many people cannot have empathy for Janay Rice's situation beyond her status as a victim of horrible violence. Life is complicated, particularly for abused women and children, when love and security is all wrapped up in control and fear. It's very easy for people on the outside to dispense judgment against her for staying but a little understanding about this dynamic is called for.<br />
<br />
There's a ton of good stuff &nbsp;being written about this today, but someone called this piece by Hilzoy at Obsidion Wings to my attention and if you read only one thing about this, choose that. &nbsp;As someone who worked for years in battered women's shelters she brought some important personal experience to the issue of "why did she stay?" After addressing the unfortunately fairly common motivation that some abusers threaten their victims' lives if they try to leave, she discusses the psychology that can trap women into this dynamic.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2009/04/why-do-they-stay.html">Here's just one early aspect of it:</a><br />
<blockquote>
To start with, it helps to know that (last time I checked) the two most common times for violence to start were the honeymoon and the first pregnancy. By the time you reach either point, you're already in a pretty serious relationship, and leaving is not something that anyone would do lightly.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the violence often comes as a real surprise. It's not that there aren't signs: there are. But they are often things like: he falls for you too hard and too fast, or: he wants to be with you all the time. You'd have to be either paranoid or a victim of a previous abusive relationship to leap to the conclusion that either of these things means that abuse might be in your future. (Imagine, in particular, someone whose last relationship was with someone who didn't seem to care about her: imagine her saying to herself: last time he didn't care enough; this time he seems to care too much; am I impossible to please?)<br />
<br />
So imagine yourself, in love with someone, on your honeymoon or pregnant, when suddenly this guy just goes ballistic, often for very little reason, and hits you. For a lot of women, this is profoundly shocking and disorienting. There are things that are comprehensible parts of the world, even if they're rare, like having your car stolen; and then there are things that are unexpected in a completely different sense, like having your car turn into an elephant before your eyes: things that make you wonder whether you're completely crazy. Being beaten up by someone who apparently loves you is one of those things.<br />
<br />
What this means is that precisely when a woman needs as much confidence in her own judgment as she can muster, the rug is completely pulled out from under her. And it's not just that she questions her judgment because she got involved with this guy in the first place; she questions her judgment because something so completely alien to the world she thinks she knows has just happened.<br />
<br />
Under the circumstances, it is very, very hard to say: well, OK, I am married and/or pregnant, I am in this serious relationship,  but I will nonetheless decide to leave, now, because I think I have to, and I trust my judgment. Trusting your judgment at that moment is like trusting your sense of balance when someone has just poured a fifth of vodka down your throat</blockquote>
All the women I know, including myself, have engaged in endless rounds of second guessing and self-examination in relationships. Everything seems somewhat mysterious on a certain level in the beginning and a sense of not being able to take anything at face value overrides your own instincts in any number of ways. Most of the time despite your best efforts to understand what's going on, whether good or bad, you end up taking a leap of faith.  And that leap is significant enough that just as you wonder if his failing to call for three days means he's backing off, you might also wonder if that angry shove or slap really means that he's a violent abuser. Everything seems in question --- you don't know what's real and what isn't half the time. The positive side of that is the excitement and challenge of a new relationsip.  Unfortunately, the negative side is that you can end up committing to someone who hurts you, sometimes physically <br />
<br />
Anyway, Hilzoy's piece gets into all that psychology and it's truly important that people read about this and realize that the violent relationship dynamic isvery deeply embedded in the human psyche and our social fabric. If we want to change this and truly make it rare and costly in our culture we're going to have to step back and recognize the complexity of it for both abuser and abused. Simply saying "she should have left him" is part of the problem.<br />

As the word "barbaric" quickly becomes the most overused word in the English language and we see <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2747965/I-ve-never-seen-Border-Patrol-Filmmaker-shows-Ebola-infected-ISIS-terrorist-sneak-Lake-Erie-Canada-Cleveland-RICIN-Rock-Roll-Hall-Fame.html">the threat of ISIS</a> being raised to hysterical levels not seen since Orsen Welles' <i>War of the Worlds</i> broadcast on the cusp of World War in 1938, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/twenty-eight-pages?utm_source=tny&amp;utm_campaign=generalsocial&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;mbid=social_twitter">this strikes me as interesting:</a><br />
<blockquote>
On the bottom floor of the United States Capitol’s new underground visitors’ center, there is a secure room where the House Intelligence Committee maintains highly classified files. One of those files is titled “Finding, Discussion and Narrative Regarding Certain Sensitive National Security Matters.” It is twenty-eight pages long. In 2002, the Administration of George W. Bush excised those pages from the report of the Joint Congressional Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks. President Bush said then that publication of that section of the report would damage American intelligence operations, revealing “sources and methods that would make it harder for us to win the war on terror.”<br />
<br />
“There’s nothing in it about national security,” Walter Jones, a Republican congressman from North Carolina who has read the missing pages, contends. “It’s about the Bush Administration and its relationship with the Saudis.” Stephen Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat, told me that the document is “stunning in its clarity,” and that it offers direct evidence of complicity on the part of certain Saudi individuals and entities in Al Qaeda’s attack on America. “Those twenty-eight pages tell a story that has been completely removed from the 9/11 Report,” Lynch maintains. Another congressman who has read the document said that the evidence of Saudi government support for the 9/11 hijacking is “very disturbing,” and that “the real question is whether it was sanctioned at the royal-family level or beneath that, and whether these leads were followed through.” Now, in a rare example of bipartisanship, Jones and Lynch have co-sponsored a resolution requesting that the Obama Administration declassify the pages.</blockquote>
<br />
I'd be shocked if they did it. Prince Bandar's self-righteous proclamations in the piece about how they have nothing to hide and want the truth out so they can properly rebut it clearly come from a man who knows this information will not be released. <br />
<br />
This is why all the fulminating among the war hawks, particularly those in government who know very well that the story is far more complicated than a bunch of Ninjas in the desert threatening to kill American babies in their beds, is so clearly disingenuous. Lindsay Graham and Mike Rogers and all the rest know very well that the threat of terrorism is very much linked to our other relationships in the Middle East and our desperate thirst for oil. They have other agendas.<br />
<br />
And the reason I brought up the word "barbaric" is because of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-executes-19-during-half-of-august-in-disturbing-surge-of-beheadings-9686063.html">this</a>, which I've been writing about <a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-5155643920455169%3A9n57li-yyvq&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=behead+saudi&amp;sa=Search&amp;siteurl=digbysblog.blogspot.com%2F&amp;ref=&amp;ss=7938j33458418j12&amp;siteurl=digbysblog.blogspot.com%2F&amp;ref=&amp;ss=7938j33458438j12#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=beheaded%20saudi">for some time</a>.(And if you think the Saudi "system of justice" means the subjects of their beheading are guilty, consider that they are beheading people for using drugs, homosexualty and stealing.) <br />
<br />
This is why we must be clear headed about this latest threat of Middle Eastern terrorism. There is a lot of smoke and many mirrors in this thing.<br />
<br />
<b>Update: </b> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/08/steven-sotloff-sold-to-isis_n_5788312.html?utm_hp_ref=tw">Consider this as well:</a><br />
<br />
<blockquote>
Steven Sotloff, the American journalist murdered by Islamic State militants last week, was sold to the terrorist organization by supposedly moderate rebels in Syria, a family spokesman told CNN on Monday night.<br />
<br />
"For the first time, we can say Steven was sold at the border. Steven's name was on a list that he had been responsible for the bombing of a hospital," Barak Barfi said on "Anderson Cooper 360." "This was false, activists spread his name around."<br />
<br />
"We believe that these so-called moderate rebels that people want our administration to support, one of them sold him probably for something between $25,000 and $50,000 to ISIS, and that was the reason he was captured," Barfi told Cooper.<br />
<br />
Barfi credited "sources on the ground" for providing the information, including details of the capture.<br />
<br />
"Somebody at the border crossing made a phone call to ISIS and they set up a fake checkpoint with many people and Steven and his people that he went in with could not escape," he said.<br />
<br />
Barfi also described relations between the Sotloff family and the Obama administration as "strained," and railed against what he called "inaccurate statements" put out by the U.S. government.<br />
<br />
"We know that the intelligence community and the White House are enmeshed in a larger game of bureaucratic infighting and Jim and Steve are pawns in this game and that's not fair and if there continues to be leaks the Sotloff family will have to speak out to set the record straight," he said.<br />
<br />
"Jim" refers to James Foley, an American photojournalist also murdered by Islamic State militants. Islamic State is sometimes referred to as ISIS or ISIL.<br />
<br />
Both Foley and Sotloff were beheaded by the terrorists, who released videos of the killings online.</blockquote>
<br />
I know that comic book superheroes and video game warriors all have special powers to know the "good guys" from the "bad guys" but unfortunately, in real life, in a situation like this, no such powers exist. Such complexity argues for skepticism and caution. Obviously.<br />
<br />
*And yes, it would be awhole lot better if the US Government didn't cover up crimes, hide its real agenda and lie constantly. The old fable about the boy who cried wolf applies to powerful governments as well.<br />
<br />

The New York Times editorial page the other day turned it's ire on the voter fraud squad. Specifically, on Texas where the Justice Department and other groups are in court challenging its absurdly restrictive 2011 identity card law. (Almost as absurd as North Carolina's.) The Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/opinion/voter-id-on-trial-in-texas.html?_r=1">states the obviou</a>s: These laws are about erecting obstacles to Democratic-leaning voters voting.<blockquote><p>The laws’ backers rely on a <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2007/2007_07_21">2008 Supreme Court ruling</a> upholding an Indiana voter-ID law, but at least two of the judges in that case have since admitted they were wrong. Richard Posner, a federal appeals court judge who approved the law, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/opinion/second-thoughts-on-voter-id.html?ref=editorials">said last fall</a> that voter-ID laws were “now widely regarded as a means of voter suppression rather than of fraud prevention.” And former Justice John Paul Stevens, who voted with the majority, <a href="http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/judge-posner-regrets-the-error/">said</a> that in retrospect the dissent was “dead right.”</p>
<p>Rather than find a way to appeal to a wider swath of voters, Republican lawmakers rig the game with pointless obstacles to voting. The courts are finally catching on, but in the meantime, many of the nation’s most vulnerable citizens <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/us/politics/texas-stringent-voter-id-law-makes-a-dent-at-polls.html?_r=0">are shut out</a> of the democratic process.</p></blockquote><p>Oh, you have to give the voter fraud squads their due for dedication. Whatever else, they are persistent. The "evidence" they produce to support their claims of rampant fraud are voluminous. What they lack in quality they make up for in quantity. Fraud theorists have never produced actual wrongdoers in numbers to justify claims of widespread fraud. But statistical analyses? They produce those in bulk.</p><p>

They've got nothing. But we are to be impressed by the sheer volume of the nothing. So much so that we will agree to requiring every American to present a photo identity card before voting. Because nothing says freedom like a government official asking to see your papers.</p><p>

Striking down Pennsylvania’s voter ID law in January, its state court found "no evidence of the existence of in-person voter fraud in the state.” Plus, the state <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/179581/federal-court-strikes-down-discriminatory-wisconsin-voter-id-law#">failed to establish</a> any connection between photo identity cards and the integrity of elections. Courts in Texas, Arizona, and Arkansas ruled similarly.</p><p>

Wisconsin federal district court Judge Lynn Adelman in April <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/litigation/documents/Decision042914.pdf">struck down</a> that state's voter ID law for violating the Fourteenth Amendment and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Adelman found about 9 percent of registered voters –
about 300,000 – lacked the government-issued ID required for casting a ballot under the Wisconsin law, enough to change election results.</p><p>

He wrote, “The evidence adduced at trial demonstrates that this unique burden disproportionately impacts Black and Latino voters.” Wisconsin's African American voters were "1.7 times as likely as white voters to lack a matching driver’s license or state ID and that Latino voters in Wisconsin were 2.6 times as likely as white voters to lack these forms of identification.”

Shirley Brown, for example. An African-American woman in her 70s, Brown was born at home in Louisiana and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/voting-rights/federal-court-strikes-down-wisconsin-voter-photo-id-law">never had a birth certificate</a>. Or the veteran who testified that he banks using his <a href="http://host.madison.com/federal-judge-strikes-down-wisconsin-voter-id-law/article_97419aa6-cfcc-11e3-a24a-001a4bcf887a.html">veteran’s ID</a>, but cannot use it to vote.</p><p>

"The defendants could not point to a single instance of known voter impersonation occurring in Wisconsin at any time in the recent past…" wrote Adelman, ruling that Wisconsin's ID law would prevent more legitimate votes than fraudulent ones.</p><p>

The voter fraud squad’s repeated declarations of a widespread crime wave are long on anecdotes and short on perpetrators. All smoke, no fire. Their spreading unsubstantiated “<a href="http://www.beaufortobserver.net/Articles-NEWS-and-COMMENTARY-c-2014-05-01-272549.112112-More-voter-fraudvote-often-wherever-you-can.html">wild stories</a>” helps generate support for erecting obstacles to honest citizens sharing in responsibility for governing America.</p><p>

That is utterly wrongheaded.</p><p>

Former Colorado Senate Majority Leader Ken Gordon (D-Denver) expressed a perspective more in keeping with traditional American optimism when he <a href="http://www.coloradostatesman.com/content/993634-gessler-besieged-critics-proposed-rules">said</a>, <blockquote><i>“We think that voting actually is not just a private vote for the person who gets the vote, but a public good, and that the more people who vote, the more legitimate the elected officials are, and that they represent the actual values of the electorate.”</i></blockquote></p><p>

Isn’t that what we all want?</p><br>

<a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/08/scalias_utter_moral_failure_how_he_destroys_any_claim_to_a_superior_system_of_justice/">I did a piece today </a>for Salon about Uncle Nino's utter depravity that you might like:<br />
<blockquote>
[H]e cited this particular case in the decision on Collins v. Collins back in 1994 in which he disagreed with Justice Harry Blackmun on the constitutionality of the death penalty. This was the famous case in which Justice Blackmun disavowed his former support for capital punishment and declared that he would no longer “tinker with the machinery of death.” Scalia wrote, with characteristic sarcasm:<br />
<blockquote>
Justice Blackmun begins his statement by describing with poignancy the death of a convicted murderer by lethal injection. He chooses, as the case in which to make that statement, one of the less brutal of the murders that regularly come before us, the murder of a man ripped by a bullet suddenly and unexpectedly, with no opportunity to prepare himself and his affairs, and left to bleed to death on the floor of a tavern. The death-by-injection which Justice Blackmun describes looks pretty desirable next to that. It looks even better next to some of the other cases currently before us, which Justice Blackmun did not select as the vehicle for his announcement that the death penalty is always unconstitutional, for example, the case of the 11-year-old girl raped by four men and then killed by stuffing her panties down her throat. How enviable a quiet death by lethal injection compared with that!”</blockquote>
Yes, how very enviable. Unless the defendants are<i> innocent</i>, in which case it is as horrifying as the brutal slaying of the victim, particularly after 30 years spent imprisoned in a small cell waiting for the day that he will know in advance he is to die. That alone is cruel and unusual punishment. Not that Justice Scalia sees it that way.  (His comments suggest that the methods of punishment should be directly correlated to the luridness of the crime, an antediluvian concept rejected by the Enlightenment-influenced writers of the Constitution he alleges to take so literally.)</blockquote>
I call him depraved because he thinks that factual innocence doesn't matter but believes that what he is doing is moral. Is there a better word to describe him? <br />
<br />
Honestly, this man has something wrong with him. He has no business being in such a powerful position. The fact that he holds such an esteemed place in our society says as much about us as it does about him.<br />

			<b>UPDATE: Why Does Fox News Side with Abusers like Ray Rice?</b><br />
<br />
by Spocko<br />
<br />
Today's Ray Rice story is still developing, but one thing it illustrates is the role outsiders can play in demanding justice and then expecting change from an institution that failed to act--or failed to act with sufficient seriousness about a problem.<br />
<br />
Digby and Perlstein <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-ramifications-of-pardon.html">wrote&nbsp;today about </a>what happened when we failed to hold individuals accountable for malfeasance. &nbsp;When institutions protect individuals, by explaining away their actions, it prevents change from happening.<br />
<br />
The other thing it is illustrating is how great it is to have a group of people like Fox News or the RW media on your side, even if only temporarily.<br />
<br />
Last week I wrote this piece, <a href="http://my.firedoglake.com/spocko/2014/08/29/video-ceo-abuses-puppy-why-rw-media-supports-abusers-instead-victims/">CEO Abuses Puppy. Why RW Media Supports Abusers Instead of Victims.</a> I wondered how the RW media would act when they were told to be on the abusers' side.<br />
<br />
Well today we saw just a peek of what that might look like on Fox and Friends. Now they aren't <b>totally </b>on the side of Rice, but they are able to<a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/09/08/fox-hosts-giggle-that-nfl-players-abused-girlfriend-should-learn-to-take-the-stairs/"> get in some victim blaming and pass on some protective advice to their abusing buddies</a>.<br />
<br />

<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
“We should also point out, after that video — and now you know what happened in there — she still married him,” host Steve Doocy explained. “They are currently married.”&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
“Rihanna went back to Chris Brown right after [he assaulted her],” co-host Brian Kilmeade noted. “A lot of people thought that was a terrible message.”</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
“I think the message is take the stairs,” he added, as co-host Anna Kooiman giggled.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
“The message is, when you’re in an elevator, there’s a camera,” Doocy concluded.</blockquote>
<br />
Kilmeade says to avoid the situation whereas Doocy, the really brains of the outfit, says to avoid the cameras. The person who might be the most righteously upset, Anna Kooiman, first defends football in general (avoiding addressing NFL's policies) and then giggles at a lame joke.<br />
<br />
The message isn't "don't do something nasty," but "don't get caught doing nasty things on video."<br />
<br />
I've read that <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/08/ray_rice_fired_but_every_other_terrible_person_associated_with_the_ravens_still_has_a_job/">Rice has now been fired </a>and supposedly some changes will happen at the NFL. &nbsp;Enough people were outraged, and let them know it, that the NFL's weak measures were deemed not enough. &nbsp;The firing is important, but it is the promised changes that we hope will have a lasting impact, we need to keep an eye on.<br />
<br />
Will there be any changes at Fox and Friends for their victim blaming? Nope, of course not. Because <b>their </b>institution is doing exactly what it was designed to do, <b>protect the abusers in their club,&nbsp;</b>instead of the victims.<br />
<br />
Fox and Friends aired before Rice had been drummed out of their club, so they didn't have to defend him full throatily. &nbsp;If they had, they might have started talking about how, "He's the real victim here" because of concussion damage from football. But they got the word from on high, the real client is the NFL.<br />
<br />
They will be defending the NFL in the future, and whatever actions they were forced to take to get the rabble to simmer down. <br />
<br />
Fox knows that the real clients are the members of the club who pay their bills. The $9 billion dollars a year in revenue, non-profit club calling themselves the NFL.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>UPDATE from Raven’s Press conference.</b><br />
<br />
I just watched the Raven’s Press conference. I don’t want to bag on the reporters, they are probably used to asking athletes questions and getting answers like, “We came to play,” but when talking to the coach about this issue, they could have pressed harder, this is hard news.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Reporter: <b>Why didn't you have access to the tape before today?</b></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Raven's Coach: I<b> have no answer to that.&nbsp;</b></blockquote>
(Short&nbsp;<a href="http://www.spockosbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/I-have-no-answer-for-that.mp4?_=1">Educational video link for &nbsp;the purpose of media criticism)</a><br />
<br />
And that was it. No follow ups. A few "How do you feel?" questions that the coach batted way. &nbsp;Okay then.<br />
<br />
No follow up like, “Well can we talk to someone who DOES have the answer?”<br />
<br />
So to follow up on my theme, in my "<a href="http://my.firedoglake.com/spocko/2014/08/29/video-ceo-abuses-puppy-why-rw-media-supports-abusers-instead-victims/">CEO kicks dog</a>" post, Knowing who controls and uses a powerful video like is a big fraking deal, &nbsp;Who sees the video and when they see it can be a huge power play story. Politicians get this.<br />
<br />
I understand that the sports reporters are used to being deferential to the coach, but will else anyone dig into this? &nbsp; I’m guess we won't know anything more until Rice's lawyers file the “wrongful termination” suit and everyone will lawyer up and the case will be sealed.<br />
<br />
I want something besides spectacle &nbsp;to come from this. I want people to think about what they want when they see this kind of video. Do you want some changes in the NFL around domestic violence? &nbsp;Do you want to get them to admit it's not just about cutting loose a "bad apple" and an "isolated case?" but a systemic, and institutional problem? That could be one of the outcomes from this kind of evidence. Is that blackmail? Or is it leverage?<br />

The hysterical pearl clutching of the panic artists like Lindsay Graham and his helpmates in the media has <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/08/politics/cnn-poll-isis/index.html">succeeded: </a><br />
<blockquote>
Americans are increasingly concerned that ISIS represents a direct terror threat, fearful that ISIS agents are living in the United States, according to a new CNN/ORC International poll. Most now support military action against the terrorist group.<br />
Seven in 10 Americans believe ISIS has the resources to launch an attack against the United States, just days before President Barack Obama plans to address the nation on the subject.<br />
The poll released Monday shows that Americans favor:&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote>
-- Additional airstrikes against ISIS (76% favor, 23% oppose)<br />
<br />
-- Military aid to forces fighting ISIS (62% favor, 37% oppose)&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote>
-- Providing humanitarian aid to people fleeing ISIS (83% favor, 16% oppose)</blockquote>
They do not favor boots on the ground though although I don't know why.  If these monsters are here in der Homeland plotting to invade Dubuque you'd think Americans would want the government to pull out all the stops. But I guess they figure we can use our "superpowers" to defeat the crazed terrorists over there so they won't deploy their evil plots here without having to lose any soldiers. We just have to use our best secret laser beam technology to "take out" the bad guys without risking the lives of anyone important. We can do that. We're that good.<br />
<br />
We Americans don't go by "keep calm and carry on" or even "we have nothing to fear but fear itself." &nbsp; Our credo is:<br />
<br />
<i>&nbsp;"ohmygodbombsomethingnowtheyarecomingtokillusallinourbeds!"</i><br />
<br />
Very impressive.<br />
<br />
In case you were wondering, the actual experts are saying something quite different from the Chicken Littles:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://news.antiwar.com/2014/08/22/fbi-admits-no-credible-threats-to-us-from-isis/">There is no specific or credible threat of an ISIS terror attack on the US.</a><br />

Salon is featuring <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/08/watergates_most_lasting_sin_gerald_ford_richard_nixon_and_the_pardon_that_made_us_all_cynics/">a great read this morning from Rick Perlstein</a> on the Nixon pardon and he makes a point which I don't think most people realize:  it was hugely unpopular at the time but was later accepted as something that "bound up the nation's wounds" and provided a sense of stability. (It's funny --- I thought it was a good idea at the time and later came to realize that I was completely daft for thinking that.  My only excuse is that I was very young.)<br />
<br />
Perlstein writes:<br />
<blockquote>
For political elites took away a dangerous lesson from the Ford pardon—our true shame: all it takes is the incantation of magic words like “stability” and “confidence” and “consensus” in order to inure yourself from accountability for just about any malfeasance.<br />
<br />
In 1975 the Senate and House empaneled committees to investigate the CIA, FBI, and, later, the NSA after it was discovered these agencies had operated unethically and illegally. The House committee, under Rep. Otis Pike, who died last year in obscurity, discovered not merely that the CIA was out of control, but that it was incompetent—for instance, predicting Mideast peace the week before the Yom Kippur War broke out. Frank Church’s Senate committee, meanwhile, proved the NSA was illegally gathering the telegraph traffic of American citizens, without even top executives of the telegraph companies being aware of it.<br />
<br />
But, in the spirit of the Nixon pardon, the idea of holding elite institutions to reckoning had fallen out of favor. At the height of the intelligence investigations Washington Post’s publisher Katharine Graham complained of the media’s tendency to “see a conspiracy and cover-up in everything.” Senator J. William Fulbright said “these are not the kind of truths we need most right now”—that the nation demanded “restored stability and confidence” instead. The CIA had no trouble promptly drumming up a disingenuous propaganda campaign that all but neutered reform. And, 39 years later, these institutions are still largely broken, and still almost entirely unaccountable.</blockquote>
Perlstein sees it as a seminal moment for our country and I agree.  It's rare that you have such clear evidence of outright corruption and abuse of governmental power in high office in real time.  That pardon sent a message loud and clear --- only history will judge you. I'm sure that's a tough thing for a politician to take but it isn't the same as being forced to face what you did and be accountable for it. I can think of a million ways a person can rationalize their decisions for history. (George W. Bush: "History? Who knows?  We'll all be dead...") But having to explain yourself under the legal system is a very different thing.  <br />
<br />
I would just add that the embarrassing farce that was the Clinton impeachment put the final nail in the coffin. The soaring rhetoric about "the rule of law" and the feigned moral outrage over such a mundane, private matter showed the entire world that the United States' high minded notions of morality and justice had finally evolved into nothing more than a vulgar joke. <br />

			<p><b>Privileged lanes</b></p>
<p>by Tom Sullivan</p>

<p>Can't stop thinking about Ferguson, MO.</p>

<p>Over at <a href="http://alittlemoresauce.com/2014/08/20/what-my-bike-has-taught-me-about-white-privilege/">A Little More Sauce</a>, jdowsett draws an analogy between bicycle riding and white privilege that doesn't rely on impugning anyone's character. But he very cleverly uses the highway infrastructure's bias towards cars over bicycles to illuminate how the social infrastructure is skewed in ways many rarely notice.</p>

<blockquote>I can imagine that for people of color life in a white-majority context feels a bit like being on a bicycle in midst of traffic. They have the right to be on the road, and laws on the books to make it equitable, but that doesn’t change the fact that they are on a bike in a world made for cars. Experiencing this when I’m on my bike in traffic has helped me to understand what privilege talk is really about.</p><p>

Now most people in cars are not intentionally aggressive toward me. But even if all the jerks had their licenses revoked tomorrow, the road would still be a dangerous place for me. Because the whole transportation infrastructure privileges the automobile. It is born out of a history rooted in the auto industry that took for granted that everyone should use a car as their mode of transportation. It was not built to be convenient or economical or safe for me.</p><p>

And so people in cars—nice, non-aggressive people—put me in danger all the time because they see the road from the privileged perspective of a car. E.g., I ride on the right side of the right lane. Some people fail to change lanes to pass me (as they would for another car) or even give me a wide berth. Some people fly by just inches from me not realizing how scary/dangerous that is for me (like if I were to swerve to miss some roadkill just as they pass). These folks aren’t aggressive or hostile toward me, but they don’t realize that a pothole or a build up of gravel or a broken bottle, which they haven’t given me enough room to avoid–because in a car they don’t need to be aware of these things–could send me flying from my bike or cost me a bent rim or a flat tire.</blockquote><p>I've been there. Most drivers are courteous or else oblivious, and even that has its hazards. Still, back in the day I had cans and bottles thrown, was yelled at, run off the road -- even shot at. As a cyclist, if you're not invisible you're at best a second-class citizen. And for a few drivers, a target of opportunity. The <a href="http://alittlemoresauce.com/2014/08/20/what-my-bike-has-taught-me-about-white-privilege/">analogy</a> rings true.</p><p>

<blockquote>It’s a way of trying to make visible the fact that system is not neutral, it is not a level-playing field, it’s not the same experience for everyone. There are biases and imbalances and injustices built into the warp and woof of our culture. (The <a href="https://alittlemoresauce.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/the-death-of-mike-brown-and-the-death-of-the-church/">recent events in Ferguson</a>, MO should be evidence enough of this–more thoughts on that <a href="https://alittlemoresauce.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/the-death-of-mike-brown-and-the-death-of-the-church/">here</a>). Not because you personally are a racist, but because the system has a history and was built around this category “race” and that’s not going to go away overnight (or even in 100 years).</blockquote><p>Radley Balko provided some of the <a href="http://www.digbysblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/dickensian-doesnt-begin-to-describe-st.html">political history</a> leading up to the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/09/03/how-st-louis-county-missouri-profits-from-poverty/">Washington Post </a>. It's a long, but worthwhile read.</p>

Not being a religious person I can't really speak to this.  I know the old testament was all eye-for-an-eye.  But I thought Jesus was a different kind of guy.<br />
<br />
I'm going to guess that it isn't a theological disagreement that explains the difference between all these white Christians and the black and brown ones though.<br />
<br />
The good news is that <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2014/03/28/shrinking-majority-of-americans-support-death-penalty/">the death penalty is a lot less popular than it used to be</a>. &nbsp;Then again, for reasons that should be obvious, it was a lot less popular before 1968 than it is now when political leaders started demagoguing "law and order" and suddenly a whole bunch of people decided it was a really good idea after all. We still haven't reverted back.<br />

So Republican Senator Marco Rubio went on television <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2014/09/rubio-hundreds-of-isil-fighters-have-easy-access-to-195015.html">to reassure America</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Sen. Marco Rubio said on Sunday the Islamic State presents a threat “here in the homeland” thanks to hundreds of European and American fighters whose passports could grant them easy access to the United States.<br />
<br />
“This group has among their ranks hundreds, if not thousands, of people with the capacity of entering the United States quickly and easily,” the Florida Republican said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”</blockquote><br />
Oh my dear God!  They're coming to kill us all in our beds! Thank goodness we have leaders like Marco Rubio with a real plan to save us:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Rubio called for a “sustained air campaign” in Syria that targets ISIL leaders, supply lines and even oil refineries they control and use to generate revenue.</blockquote><br />
Yep, there you have it.  According to all the beltway Chicken Littles, the monsters are coming to kill us, <i>thousands of them</i> but we can stop it with a bombing campaign in Syria to kill the leaders and disrupt their supply lines  ("even oil refineries --- gasp!). <br />
<br />
Apparently, they are planning to invade via Damascus. Perhaps using Saddam's old crop dusters, I don't know.<br />
<br />
If ISIS is sending in thousands of American and European terrorists to kill us here in "der Homeland" I'm going to guess that blowing up their supply lines in Syria isn't going to make much of a difference. Killing their leaders is always nice and perhaps a bombing campaign will get that done. One thing's for sure: it will definitely kill somebody. <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way,  this man is considered qualified to be the president of the United States. <br />

<br />
<blockquote>
Conservationists studying bats in Arizona were recently confronted by a group of armed militia members who confused them for border crossers or smugglers, a local sheriff told television station KOLD.<br />
<br />
The TV station reported on Tuesday that Santa Cruz County Sheriff Tony Estrada said the militia members were wearing camouflage and were heavily armed when they arrived on ATVs and confronted the scientists on the night of Aug. 23.<br />
<br />
"Obviously they mistook them for smugglers or illegal entrants," said Estrada. "They were armed. They put a spotlight on them."</blockquote>
<br />
We have enough trouble with thousands of yahoo cops running around armed like they're patrolling Mogadishu. Do we really need these juvenile idiots playing army with real guns? People are going to get hurt.  <br />
<br />
By the way, the "militia" group was from Colorado. <br />
<br />
<blockquote>
Sheriff Estrada says Santa Cruz County does not welcome border militia groups.<br />
<br />
"These people that are completely out of their environment. They really don't know the area. They don't know the terrain. They have little knowledge of the dynamics of the border. So it can be a real problem," Estrada says. "We really don't want them here."<br />
<br />
"It can be a problem for them. It can be a problem for the people, just like in this particular case. Things could have gone terribly wrong."</blockquote>
<br />
I'm going to guess that Arizona has enough armed nutballs of their own to deal with.<br />

			<p><b>Dickensian doesn't begin to describe St. Louis County</b></p>
<p>by Tom Sullivan</p>

<p>Your dystopian future has arrived. NPR's May series, <a href="http://www.npr.org/series/313986316/guilty-and-charged">Guilty and Charged</a>, explored the spreading judicial practice of judging people guilty of misdemeanor offenses then imprisoning those unable to pay fines and an expanding menu of fees. (The poor.) But while practice of billing defendants for their punishment may be relatively new, the municipal courts in St. Louis County, MO, where the unarmed Michael Brown was shot by police last month, resemble something out of Dickens. Or else Terry Gilliam's <em>Brazil</em>. Radley Balko (<a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/rise-of-the-warrior-cop-radley-balko/1113024804?ean=9781610392112">Rise of the Warrior Cop</a>) painted a detailed portrait of the county's legal culture -- if you can call it that -- in the Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/09/03/how-st-louis-county-missouri-profits-from-poverty/">last week</a>.</p><p> 

It's a world in which white flight created a string of subdivisions-turned-towns stretching north and west from St. Louis. As black families followed, whites retreated or quickly established dozens of zoned, postage-stamp-sized municipalities.</p>

<blockquote>“The state’s one requirement before giving you the power to zone was that you had to incorporate and draw up a city plan,” [University of Iowa historian Colin] Gordon says. “That plan could be as simple as getting an engineer to slap a ‘single family’ zone over the entire development. Your subdivision is now a town.”</p><p>

Gordon says this is why the towns in St. Louis can have such unusual names, such as Town & Country or Bellefontaine Neighbors. “Look at a place like Black Jack in North County. It began as a private subdivision in the 1970s. When they saw the looming threat of housing projects, they quickly zoned the neighborhood as single-family and incorporated as a municipality.” Today Black Jack is more than 80 percent black. There’s a similar town of about 1,200 people near Ferguson, just across the street from the Normandy Country Club. It’s 91 percent black, has a 35 percent poverty rate, and has a median household income 40 percent below the state median. Its name? Country Club Hills.</blockquote><p>As black families filtered in, the towns too small to sustain local government with property and sales taxes made police departments into profit centers that generate revenues by shaking down residents, most of them poor.</p> 

<blockquote>“You see that sort of thing a lot,” [legal aid attorney Michael-John] Voss says. “We’ll get a client who was pulled over and cited for failure to provide proof of insurance, or driving with a suspended license. But there’s no additional citation for a moving violation. So why was she pulled over in the first place?”</blockquote><p>But the stop might generate a string of violations, fines and fees that, if not addressed, result in arrest warrants and court costs.</p>

<blockquote>There are many towns in St. Louis County where the number of outstanding arrest warrants can exceed the number of residents, sometimes several times over. No town in Jackson County comes close to that: The highest ratios are in the towns of Grandview (about one warrant for every 3.7 residents), Independence (one warrant for every 3.5 residents), and Kansas City itself (one warrant for every 1.8 residents).</blockquote><p>St. Louis County is a dispiriting labyrinth of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/editorial/a-ride-along-with-lawyers-in-the-st-louis-suburbs/2014/09/04/f79a408a-346f-11e4-9f4d-24103cb8b742_video.html">speed traps</a> and police demands to see permits and papers. Those so targeted are unlikely to afford the fees, much less an attorney to help get them discharged or reduced. Balko explains that with 23,457 pending arrest warrants in 2013 in Pine Lawn (roughly 7.3 per resident), the town brought in about $576 per resident. Antonio Morgan’s story is especially instructive and infuriating. Just trying to support his family by repairing cars makes Morgan a police target, like <em>Brazil</em>'s "terrorist" heating and air conditioning engineer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_(1985_film)">Archibald "Harry" Tuttle</a>.</p><p> 

It's a place where the poor are prey, and the prey are black. With "the every day harassment and degradation" of such a system, it's a wonder Ferguson, MO didn't explode sooner.</p><br>

From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/books/review/the-human-age-by-diane-ackerman.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22%7D&amp;_r=0">a book review</a> by Rob Nixon of <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/62-9780393240740-0">The Human Age</a> by Diane Ackerman<br />
<blockquote>
&nbsp;The 21st-century rise of the Anthropocene [the "Human Age"] as a unitary-species story coincides with a trend toward rising inequality, between the haves and the never-will-haves. In America, we call this the second Gilded Age, but in nations as diverse as China, Ireland, India, Spain and Nigeria, the idea of the human is also fracturing economically. <i>In 2013, the world’s 85 wealthiest individuals had a net worth equal to that of our planet’s 3.5 billion poorest people.</i> Since 1751, a mere 90 corporations, primarily oil and coal ­companies, have generated two-thirds of humanity’s CO2 emissions. That’s a serious concentration of earth-altering power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
When [author] Ackerman uncritically quotes the futurist Ray Kurzweil’s prediction that “by the 2030s we’ll be putting millions of nanobots inside our bodies to augment our immune system, to basically wipe out disease,” this reader was prompted to ask: Pray tell, which “we” would that be? The facts are that in 2014 the number of forcibly displaced people has topped 51 million, the highest figure since World War II. Yes, technological innovation will prove critical in the battle to adapt to the hurtling pace of planetary change, but let’s acknowledge that we’re doing a far better job of encouraging innovation than distributing possibility.</blockquote>
(Emphasis added.)<br />
<br />
Somewhat apropos, see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/business/just-13-and-working-risky-12-hour-shifts-in-the-tobacco-fields.html?&amp;hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=LargeMediaHeadlineSum&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">this unbelievably sad story</a>, too.

<b>Summer clearance</b><br />
<br />
By Dennis Hartley<br />
<br />
How does that Dream Academy song go again? Oh, yeah…<br />
<br />
<i>It was the time of year,&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>just after the summer’s gone&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>When August and September</i><br />
<i>just become memories of songs&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>To be put away with the summer clothes&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>And packed up in the attic for another year</i><br />
<br />
What they said. Anyway, that’s pretty much the mood I’ve been in. Between that and my lazy Labor Day weekend hiatus, I found myself with a backlog of recent films I haven’t got around to reviewing yet. So here’s a little “catch-up” for you (a “summer clearance”, if you will) to wrap up these few odds and ends before putting away the summer clothes:<br />

<b><i>Finding Fela</i></b>- The first 15 minutes or so of director Alex Gibney's portrait of Nigerian music legend/political icon Fela Kuti teeters on becoming a parody of <i>All That Jazz</i>. Choreographer Bill T. Jones struts and frets upon the stage, rehearsing his company for a Broadway production of Fela! (it premiered back in 2009). Jones wrestles with how to convey the complexities of Kuti's artistic, political and personal personas...while still retaining the catchy tunes and the jazz hands. However, just as you're scratching your head and wondering if the real Fela will ever show up, he does; albeit in bits and pieces. With patience, you will grok the method to Gibney's madness; he's taking the tact that Al Pacino used in <i>Looking for Richard</i>; juxtaposing the theatrical with the historical to "find" his protagonist. While jarring at first, the theatrical framing makes more sense as the film progresses, functioning as a Greek chorus to bridge the archival snippets. While fans may not discover much that hasn't already been revealed in previous documentaries, Gibney's approach is fresh; bolstered by outstanding editing and slick production values.

<b>A <i>Letter to Momo</i></b> – Here's something you don't see every day...a family-friendly anime fantasy from Japan that isn't produced by Studio Ghibli. That being said, Hiroyuki Okiyura's film plays a bit like a medley of Studio Ghibli's greatest hits; sort of a "Stars on 45" conundrum (sure sounds like the real thing, yet makes you yearn to hear the original). It’s a simple tale about a teenage girl named Momo who moves to an isolated island village with her widowed mother. Insular and slow to make new friends, Momo spends her time daydreaming and flipping through a box full of strange, antique picture books (“From the Edo era,” her great aunt tells her after offering to let her to peruse the collection at her leisure). Well, I needn’t tell you what happens once you start flipping through strange antique picture books from the Edo era…next thing you know, you’ve got a trio of goblins in your attic. They’re creepy, but they’re kooky. More significantly, they may give Momo closure on an unresolved issue regarding her late father. The hand-drawn animation is lovely, but the story meanders and the mood vacillates too frequently between family melodrama and silly slapstick to sustain any kind of consistent tone. Still, there are some genuinely touching moments; and younger kids might be more forgiving.

<b><i>Sin City: A Dame to Kill Fo</i></b>r- Co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller have put the band back together to reprise their “Raymond Chandler and Mikey Spillane go on an ether binge” shtick in this sequel to their 2005 collaboration, <i>Sin City</i>, with mixed results. As before, Miller’s eponymous graphic novel serves as the source material, and Rodriguez’s technical wizardry renders the requisitely nightmarish noir milieu in striking chiaroscuro. Hard-boiled and ultraviolent to the point of verging on self-parody, this second omnibus of loosely-connected vignettes nonetheless delivers the goods to anyone who enjoyed the first installment (I stand guilty as charged). Inversely, anyone who couldn’t connect to the previous (and similarly over-the-top) outing will likely remain underwhelmed. A sizable contingent from the previous cast returns, including Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Powers Boothe and Bruce Willis (with a nod and a wink to <i>The Sixth Sense</i>). The hands-down scene stealer is Eva Green, as the femme fatale to kill for.

<b><i>The Trip to Italy</i></b>- There’s a great exchange between returning leads Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon in Michael Winterbottom’s follow-up to the trio’s 2011 road comedy, <i>The Trip</i>, regarding “the sophomore curse” in cinema. Coogan proclaims that sequels are never as good as the original; instantly regretting his statement when Brydon quickly deadpans "...except, of course, for <i>Godfather II</i>…” and proceeds to rattle off a number of other superior sequels whilst Coogan furiously (and hilariously) attempts to backpedal. You can add this sequel to thatlist. Using a similar setup, the pair of actor-comedian pals hit the road for another restaurant tour, making a scenic upgrade from England’s Lake District to Italy’s sunny Mediterranean coast. Once again, they play slightly elevated caricatures of themselves. The comic riffing (the main reason to watch) is as brilliant as previous; covering everything from armchair psychoanalysis of Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill album to dueling Michael Caine impressions and geriatric Roger Moore jabs (“Cubby…did you get my note about the handrails?”). There’s also a more pronounced melancholic element in this outing (middle-aged malaise comes to us all, my friends). Also as before, the film was whittled down from a six-episode BBC mini-series.<br />
