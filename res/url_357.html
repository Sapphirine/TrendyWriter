And I keep failing to make my objections clear in a way that convinces him I have a point rather than simply being a Crazy-Old-Keynesian-Yelling-at-Clouds. Let me try it again:</p>

<p>The way Nick sees it, The key is money demand and money supply (at full employment). When money demand is greater than money supply, people try to cut their spending hello their income in order to build up cash balances. The problem, of course, is that one person spending is another person's income. So everyone's income falls until everyone's income is so low that people in aggregate no longer wish to build up their cash balances right now. And there the economy sits, depressed, until something happens to balance money demand and money supply (at full employment). [<strong>READ MOAR:</strong>]</p>

<h2>Macroeconomic Policy for a Stronger Recovery</h2>

<p><strong>J. Bradford DeLong <br />
Professor of Economics, U.C. Berkeley <br />
Research Associate, NBER</strong></p>

<p><em>September 30, 2009</em></p>

<p><strong>A Little Background</strong></p>

<p>About a year and a half ago&mdash;in the days after the forced merger of Bear Stearns into J.P. MorganChase, say&mdash;there was a near consensus of economists that an additional dose of expansionary fiscal policy was unlikely to be necessary.  The Congress had passed a first round of tax cut-based stimulus, the impact of which in the summer of 2008 is clearly visible in disposable personal income and perhaps visible in the tracks of estimated monthly real GDP. The near-consensus belief back then, however, was that that was the only expansionary discretionary fiscal policy move that was appropriate. <a href="http://equitablegrowth.ms.techprogress.org/?p=6401"><strong>READ MOAR</strong></a></p>

<p>When r > n+g, the case for budget surpluses and lowering the debt is strong. We believe that private investments are even more productive to society than the market rate of return on private capital formation tells us. We believe that there are private knowledge and other spillovers from private capital formation. We believe that the quasi-rents from past investments are shared among all those with market power who participate in production. Thus when the government borrows and spends, it crowds out private investments that are very profitable to society as a whole. This point is strengthened by the danger of a runaway government financial crisis should a default premium begin to incorporate itself into government borrowing rates. This point is limited only by intergenerational equity considerations: that if we think the future will be richer than the present, committing funds now to private capital formation rather than to private and government consumption worsens intergenerational inequality. <a href="http://equitablegrowth.ms.techprogress.org/?p=6388"><strong>READ MOAR</strong></a></p>

				<p>From Sewell Tyng: <em>The Campaign of the Marne</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The day of September 8th had been a particularly hard one for the French. The Ninth Army heavily engaged on its left, with its centre yielding and its right almost broken, had engaged every available battalion and no further reserves remained. In vain Foch appealed to De Langle, his neighbour to the east. The Fourth Army too was fighting a desperate battle around Vitry-le-François and had no means of lending support. The 21st Army Corps (Legrand-Girarde) which Joffre had brought from Lorraine to fill the gap between the Fourth and Ninth Armies was still ten kilometres away at nightfall.... It was at this crisis that Foch is reported to have sent his celebrated dispatch to Joffre:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Hard pressed on my right. My centre is yielding. Impossible to manoeuvre. Situation excellent. I am attacking....</p>
  </blockquote>

    <p>HHS did not ensure budget neutrality.

The 3-year, nearly $4.0 billion spending limit that HHS approved for the state’s demonstration was approximately $778 million more than what the spending limit would have been if it was based on the state’s actual payment rates for services provided to adult beneficiaries under the traditional Medicaid program.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allied intelligence knew about the V2 but had little information on how close the Germans were to making them operational. In fact the Germans had been struggling with the problem of the V2 rockets exploding in mid air. On 30th August they had introduced modifications which seemed to have solved the problem. Just before noon on the 8th a German rocket battery in occupied Belgium had pumped eight tons of alcohol and liquid oxygen into their rocket and fired it at Paris. Six people were killed and thirty-six injured.</p>
  
  <p>At 6.43pm that day Chiswick, west London was rocked by a massive explosion, closely followed by another boom that was heard across London. The first explosion had been real enough--caused by 760 kilos of Amatol. The explosion that was heard just after it was the supersonic missile breaking the sound barrier as it re-entered the atmosphere. It had been just minutes since the missile had left the Hague in Holland.</p>
  
  <p>Three people had been killed in Staveley Road, Chiswick, although casualties were light given the thirty feet wide, eight foot deep crater.</p>
  
  <p>The Brentford and Chiswick Air Raid Precautions centre reported Incident 636 of the war:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Eleven houses demolished, 15 seriously damaged and evacuated. Blast damage to 516 houses. St Thomas rest centre opened to house sixteen. The WVS [Women’s Voluntary Service] incident inquiry point opened to the 10th. 14 families re-housed, three billeted.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Attempts by the Press to report the ‘Mystery Explosion’, the site of which had been visited by several unusually senior military figures and politicians, were blocked by the censor. Locally the reason given was ‘a Gas Main explosion’. Over the following weeks Londoners were to become familiar with this phrase.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It is no secret that the people bringing the challenge to the Obamacare subsidies in the Halbig and King cases—challenges now seeking review from both the full D.C. federal appellate bench and the U.S. Supreme Court after federal appellate courts in Virginia and D.C. came out in opposite ways last month—are some of the same people who brought the 2012 constitutional challenge to the Affordable Care Act before the high court (the same counsel, and one of the same plaintiffs). What’s less known, however, is that in the 2012 constitutional case, these same challengers filed briefs describing Obamacare to the court in precisely the way they now say the statute cannot possibly be read. Namely, they assumed that the subsidies were available on the federal exchanges and went so far as to argue that the entire statute could not function as written without the subsidies….

<blockquote>
  <p>...if we want to have a space colony in the next 100 years.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p><strong>Save Earth:</strong> NASA astronomer Amy Mainzer, who studies Near Earth Objects at JPL, says our number one priority has to be here on our home planet. She told io9 that it's a pretty inhospitable universe out there, so our space colonies will probably never replace home:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>From my perspective, the most important thing we can do to be prepared for any activity far in the future is try not to wipe out life here.... The defining challenge of the next hundred years is to come to grips with creating a sustainable future here, as a minimum precursor to building a sustainable future anywhere else.</p>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li><p><strong>Change the Way the U.S. Government Plans Space Missions:</strong> Ariel Waldman....</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>If the nation decides to begin a space colony outside of low Earth orbit, you need to talk about changing the way NASA does business. Currently, NASA engages in a capabilities-based and/or "flexible path" approach in which technologies are developed with no specific set of missions in mind.... The National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Human Spaceflight... recommend[s]... NASA switch to a "pathways" approach... [with[ a horizon goal... [and] a very specific set of stepping stones along the way.... As far as technologies needed for a pathway that leads to Mars, the committee assessed 10 high priority areas in terms of the technical challenges. The 10 high priority areas are: Mars Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL), Radiation Safety, In-Space Propulsion and Power, Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles, Planetary Ascent Propulsion, Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), Habitats, Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Suits, Crew Health, and In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU - using the Mars atmosphere as a raw material).</p>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li><p><strong>Develop 3D Printing in Space:</strong> Les Johnson suggests:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>3D printing and the rocket engine are the two inventions that will eventually enable space settlement. With 3D printing you can cut that supply chain and make all the spare parts you need locally.... A colony cannot survive if it is dependent upon a supply chain from Earth. We must mine asteroids for their raw materials (making solar arrays, colony structural materials, etc from the raw materials in Near Earth Asteroids)....</p>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li><p><strong>Let Space Tourists Take Vacations in Orbital Hotels:</strong> Seth Shostack... heads up the SETI Institute.... He said that our best bet is to create a thriving space tourism industry today.... He told io9:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>At space conferences, people interested in commercializing space want to build small hotel rooms in orbit.... The big problems here are not technical--they are liabiltiy. But there is a market.... at any price point for putting people in orbit. So the first eight space hotel rooms are expensive, but then it's cheaper for next eight....</p>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li><p><strong>Figure Out How Ecosystems Work:</strong>... Hedvig Nenzen... gave us the lowdown on all the things we need to research now if we ever hope to terraform a barren world:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>I'm going to assume that we find a new planet without an ecosystem already on it. Thus, in order to live in space we will have to build something from scratch with species we bring us. Scientists are realizing that it's more and more difficult to make an ecosystem from nothing, and to know how exactly the new ecosystem might work. There are just so many details and parts in an ecosystem that we don't understand yet....</p>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li><p><strong>Build a Giant Sun Umbrella with Robots:</strong> UC Berkeley economist Brad De Long, who has written a great deal about how robots will change our future economy, noodled around late one night with a few robot-fueled ideas he shared with io9:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>It seems clear to me at least that anything done at or inside the moon's orbit over the next century will be better done by teleoperated robots, because beyond the van Allen belt and the atmosphere we become very heavy creatures that need not only water but also sheaths of lead. So I have been trying to think of something we might need to do far enough outside the moon's orbit that teleoperated robots won't do it, and that would be wildly profitable--as the late Jim Baen liked to say, successful space travel and space colonization will be exothermic, not endothermic....</p>
    
    <p>The big one, of course, is the giant sun umbrella at L1, 930,000 miles away. That is far enough that teleoperated robots controlled from a local station shielded against solar storms and cosmic rays might do much better then robots with a 10 second response leg controlled from earth, and that might be a vastly cheaper way of dealing with global warming successfully then hoping for the nuclear/better solar fairies to show up.</p>
    
    <p>Were I NASA, I would be planning for the sunshade now—both the Earth-control 10 second lag teleoperated robot and the local station controlled versions. And, of course, the moon base—perhaps robot only, alas!—for manufacturing the station would make lifting it out of the gravity well to L1 much cheaper.</p>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li><p><strong>Study How DNA Repairs Radiation Damage:</strong> Sylvain Costes is a molecular biologist at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.... He has some advice.... He told io9:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>To colonize another planet, you need to focus on biology. The best way to deal with radiation is to take nutrients that will protect you, like antioxidants. Of course, you need the right ones. NASA and other groups have shown that there are a lot of nutrients blueberries, and more efficient ones, that will protect you against radiation. It won't stop radiation, but it can mitigate the effects....</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Costes believes we need to plan for space colonies by discovering better anti-oxidants, adopting a "risk management" approach to space travel. He also notes that it's possible that some people simply may not be able to thrive in space, because their DNA doesn't recover from damage as easily as other people's.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Educate People About Our Connection to Space:</strong> Mae Jemison... the most important first step is education:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>If we are to have any hope of having a robust, healthy nation of humans living, working, growing up and excelling happily in space we have to reconnect people here on Earth today with their ancient space heritage! The task is to get people to feel that we, like our ancestors, are linked to the stars above, not just the ground beneath our feet. And to know that what we prepare now builds the future. Teach that the reason we can predict aspects of flooding today is because everyday people thousands of years ago noticed the connection of the tides to phases of the moon. And they created calendars based on the movement of the stars. Call weather and crop satellite pictures "images from space," or GPS directions "satellite navigation."... But just a rational discussion won't do it; to feel it, let's make sure that at least once a year we go outside at night with all the lights off and experience a star-studded vista!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...Bruce Bartlett brings my attention to this article noting Minnesota’s economic performance. This reminded me to check on the Philadelphia Fed’s forecast.... The cumulative growth gap between Minnesota and Wisconsin (relative to 2011M01) is forecasted to grow--rather than shrink--over the past six months.... The cumulative growth gap between Kansas and the Nation is also forecasted to rise, from the current gap of 2.7%, to 3.2%, in just the next six months...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The blue states have shot themselves in the foot with respect to overall economic growth--although not with respect to growth in per-capita income, and definitely not with respect to growth in per-capita wealth--via excessive NIMBYism. (And, I would argue, via blowback from Republican state-level tax-limitation initiatives like Proposition 13 and Proposition 2 1/2: with development population growth make the lives of state and local government officials harder and not easier, you greatly diminish the political voices for American pro-development boosterism. Blame Howard Jarvis for the fact that people from Texas cannot afford to move to the better-paying jobs waiting for them in California.)</p>

<p>Now the red states are shooting themselves in the foot definitely with respect to growth in per-capita income, definitely definitely with respect to growth in per-capita wealth, and now--perhaps--respect to the pace of overall economic growth as well. It will be interesting to see how much of a drag this "We don't need no infrastructure/We don't need no Medicaid expansion/No common core in the classroom/Biologists! Leave them kids alone!" red-state political equilibrium exerts on the regional distribution of economic activity over the next decade. Will it be enough to offset the Hispanic population influx and the continued transition to the full air-conditioning equilibrium?</p>

The Affordable Care Act is an ugly package filled with unintended consequences. One of those consequences is a significantly smaller labor force. It should be repealed and replaced with a conservative alternative. And health-care costs are projected to put Medicare and Medicaid spending on an unsustainable and destructive path, and are putting downward pressure on wages and salaries. I would make progress with conservative health-care reforms before worrying about tax reform.

Not happening:</a> Another stake in the heart of a popular anti-Obamacare claim has arrived from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which compiled the projected premium changes for 2015 in 15 states and the District of Columbia. Its finding is that premiums for the lowest-cost, most popular individual health plans will be dropping for next year, by a nationwide average of 0.8%.... 'Now that insurers have been able to see what their competitors are charging... they are making strategic adjustments in how they price...' [said the] Kaiser Family Foundation, explaining why healthcare premiums are holding steady.... That's just one of several indicators recently released that demonstrate that the Affordable Care Act is working as planned and that the parade of horribles so deeply relished by its opponents hasn't materialized."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Peter Diamond:</strong> <a href="http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/videos/33976/peter-diamond">Video: Unemployment</a> "Debates about higher structural unemployment occur when unemployment has stayed high. With monthly publication of the US Beveridge curve (the relationship between the unemployment and vacancy rates), the recent debate has focused on the shift in the Beveridge curve and whether the shift will be lasting long enough to move the full-employment point. The curve appears stable through the NBER identified business cycle through in June 2009 or possibly the month of the maximal unemployment rate in October 2009. This shift in the Beveridge curve, with the economy experiencing a higher level of unemployment than before for the same level of the vacancy rate, suggests a deterioration in the matching/hiring process in the economy. It is tempting to interpret this decline as a structural change in the way that the labor market works and thus assume that it is orthogonal to changes in aggregate demand. Indeed, an assumption that a shift in the curve is structural has been a staple of the academic literature since at least 1958. This interpretation has an obvious policy implication: however useful aggregate stabilization policies while unemployment is very high, they are likely to fail in lowering the unemployment rate all the way to the levels that prevailed before the recession, since the labor market is structurally less efficient than before in creating successful matches. This lecture reviews the theory underlying the Beveridge curve and US evidence on the ability to draw an inference of structural change from its shift or a shift in the hiring (matching) function." | <strong>Mark Thoma:</strong> <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2014/08/a-conversation-with-peter-diamond-2.html">Economist's View: A Conversation with Peter Diamond</a> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bryan Caplan:</strong> <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/09/what_every_high.html">What Every High School Junior Should Know About Going to College:</a> "College is a good deal for good students, a mediocre deal for mediocre students, and a poor deal for poor students. Once in a long while, a poor student morphs into good student. But expecting any particular poor student--yourself included--to morph into a good student is wishful thinking. How do you know if you're a good, mediocre, or poor student? Look at your past academic performance - your grades and standardized test scores.... The main reason why college is a good deal for good students, a mediocre deal for mediocre students, and a poor deal for poor students: good students usually finish college, mediocre students usually don't, and poor students almost never do. And most of the payoff for college comes from finishing.... When you decide whether to go to college, you should consider the college experience as well as the career benefits.... A good rule of thumb: If your studies bore you in high school, they'll probably bore you in college too.... Suppose your 150-pound friend dreams of being a professional football player. Would a true friend urge him on?  No, he'd warn his mid-weight friend that he is astronomically unlikely to succeed.... I'm trying to play the same role for mediocre and poor students who expect to succeed in college. Please don't get mad at me. I am only a messenger..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rajiv Sethi:</strong> <a href="http://rajivsethi.blogspot.de/2014/09/the-core-project.html">The CORE Project</a> "Back in October 2012 I got an unexpected email from Wendy Carlin.... 'I think that a curriculum that places before students the best of the current state of economic knowledge addressed to the pressing problems of concern... could succeed.' I attended the meeting, and joined a group that would swell to incorporate more than two dozen economists spread across four continents... with funding from the Institute of New Economic Thinking, we began to assemble a set of teaching materials under the banner of Curriculum Open-Access Resources in Economics (CORE). A beta version of the resulting e-book, simply called The Economy, is now available free of charge worldwide to anyone interested in using it.... So if you're teaching an introductory economics course, or enrolled in one, or just interested in the material, just register here for complete access without charge. We will eventually set up instructor diaries to consolidate feedback, and welcome suggestions for improvement. This is just the start of a long but hopefully significant and transformative process of creative destruction." </p></li>

I think the key word is 'taboo'. Yes, exactly: 'The "lowbrow" theories of 1920-1980 from Fisher, Wicksell, Keynes, and Hicks through Metzler, Tobin, and Friedman--are taboo. They would be demonstrating to their peers that they were not serious highbrow economists if they consulted them.' That's the thing about taboos--you can't violate them just a little, you aren't allowed to mention the possibility of considering maybe violating them some day. Other slighly less useful words are 'orthodoxy', 'doctrine', 'heresy', and 'betrayal'. You can't expect an Eastern Orthodox theologian to consider the possibility that the holy spirit proceeds mostly from the father but maybe 1 or 2% of it proceeds from the Son (in any case at least when the Federal Funds rate is under 0.25%). Similarly you can't expect a Midwestern Orthodox Macroeconomist to consider the possibility that Keynes might have said something useful on some Easter Sunday."</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>...A large number of people seem to think this.... Mitt Romney’s infamous '47 percent' speech.... Casey Mulligan.... Kurt Mitman.... Jordan Weissmann.... But... if government programs are paying people not to work, then that should put upward pressure on real wages.... But... that’s not what we see happening.... Economics 101 says that when the price of something and the quantity produced both fall, demand, not supply, has fallen. In America, the price of labor and the quantity of labor have both fallen and stayed low since 2009. That is a hint that the government’s welfare programs are having only a minimal impact.... So what is it? Well, I don’t think anyone really knows why these long stagnations happen. I suspect that it has something to do with the aftermath of financial crises, but the link is not yet well understood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I, by contrast, think that we do understand very well why it is that stagnations continue once the economy has gotten wedged. <a href="http://equitablegrowth.ms.techprogress.org/?p=6326"><strong>READ MOAR</strong></a></p>

				<p>Two things that came across the transom this weekend:</p>

<p>First, Elizabeth Stoker Buenig writing on <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2014/09/weekend-reading-elizabeth-stoker-bruenig-civility-outrage.html">Civility [and] Outrage</a> after being attacked for writing that it is morally questionable to seek fame and fortune by kicking down against those unfortunate enough not to have been born to the right parents or who have been unlucky in other ways.</p>

<p>I have always thought that there are three major sins of the intellect:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Cruelty</strong>--that is, kicking down in the hope that it will make the lives of the unlucky worse for, relative to the unlucky, <em>contra</em> John Donne the writer is indeed an island.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Laziness</strong>--that is, failing to inform oneself about the issues, and failing to think through the problems: failing to use your intelligence to any purpose.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stubbornness</strong>--that is, failing to properly update one's beliefs when new evidence comes in, and turning instead to elaborating reasons for why the new evidence doesn't mean what it means: using one's intelligence for a malign purpose to keep yourself from properly marking one's beliefs to market.</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>...has arrived from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which compiled the projected premium changes for 2015 in 15 states and the District of Columbia. Its finding is that premiums for the lowest-cost, most popular individual health plans will be dropping for next year, by a nationwide average of 0.8%.... 'Now that insurers have been able to see what their competitors are charging... they are making strategic adjustments in how they price...' [said the] Kaiser Family Foundation, explaining why healthcare premiums are holding steady.... That's just one of several indicators recently released that demonstrate that the Affordable Care Act is working as planned and that the parade of horribles so deeply relished by its opponents hasn't materialized...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...I don’t think I’m a particularly harsh interlocutor. While I sometimes happen into them, I don’t like twitter  fights. When I argue I prefer to keep the points neat, discrete, and narrow. This is to keep things topical and non-personal. That’s just how I prefer to argue in public--keeps the headaches to a minimum. Nonetheless I am still from time to time accused of being uncivil. This is usually in the context of me writing about something odious someone has said, like when that Federalist dude said we should shame poor kids, or when Erick Erickson said poor people negotiating better working conditions are “failures at life.” In these cases critics usually don’t take exception with what I’ve argued, they just suggest it would’ve been better if I had done so differently — usually that means in a kinder, gentler, more soothing way.</p>
  
  <p>But I’ve gotten suspicious of this brand of criticism--which is not uncommon--and so I’ve put together a list here of reasons I seriously question the cult of civility:</p>

				<p><strong>Peter Diamond:</strong> <a href="http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/videos/33976/peter-diamond">Video: Unemployment</a> "Debates about higher structural unemployment...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...occur when unemployment has stayed high. With monthly publication of the US Beveridge curve (the relationship between the unemployment and vacancy rates), the recent debate has focused on the shift in the Beveridge curve and whether the shift will be lasting long enough to move the full-employment point. The curve appears stable through the NBER identified business cycle through in June 2009 or possibly the month of the maximal unemployment rate in October 2009. This shift in the Beveridge curve, with the economy experiencing a higher level of unemployment than before for the same level of the vacancy rate, suggests a deterioration in the matching/hiring process in the economy. It is tempting to interpret this decline as a structural change in the way that the labor market works and thus assume that it is orthogonal to changes in aggregate demand. Indeed, an assumption that a shift in the curve is structural has been a staple of the academic literature since at least 1958. This interpretation has an obvious policy implication: however useful aggregate stabilization policies while unemployment is very high, they are likely to fail in lowering the unemployment rate all the way to the levels that prevailed before the recession, since the labor market is structurally less efficient than before in creating successful matches. This lecture reviews the theory underlying the Beveridge curve and US evidence on the ability to draw an inference of structural change from its shift or a shift in the hiring (matching) function. | <strong>Mark Thoma:</strong> <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2014/08/a-conversation-with-peter-diamond-2.html">Economist's View: A Conversation with Peter Diamond</a> </p>

Job vacancies were rising, but the unemployment rate was not declining, fueling a debate about a structural problem in the labor markets. Exactly four years ago, we... argued that it was too early to call what had happened a shift.... We concluded that the Beveridge curve behavior we were seeing in this recovery was typical of recoveries in general, and that the curve would likely follow its historical business-cycle pattern going forward, erasing any evidence of a shift. Well, four years later, we have 16 more quarterly data points to inform us.... It is safe to say that what seemed like a shift in the Beveridge curve ended up being another manifestation of the 'normal' dynamics of unemployment and vacancies in the United States..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Noah Smith:</strong> <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-04/job-shortage-or-stagnation-vacation">Job Shortage or Stagnation Vacation?:</a> "Are Americans working less because the government is paying them not to work? A large number of people seem to think this. Obviously the idea is popular on the right--recall Mitt Romney’s infamous '47 percent' speech in 2012. But a surprising number... have picked up the idea.... Casey Mulligan.... Kurt Mitman.... Jordan Weissmann.... Economists... like simple stories... like effects that they understand... the idea that taxes are an incentive not to work is a simple, uncontroversial idea....But... if government programs are paying people not to work, then that should put upward pressure on real wages.... But when we look at the data, that’s not what we see happening.... When you break up the wage data by percentile, it looks even worse for the vacation thesis.... Economics 101 says that when the price of something and the quantity produced both fall, demand, not supply, has fallen. In America, the price of labor and the quantity of labor have both fallen and stayed low since 2009. That is a hint that the government’s welfare programs are having only a minimal impact on the number of Americans with jobs. Whatever caused us to stagnate for five years and counting, it probably wasn’t welfare."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chris Blattman:</strong> <a href="http://chrisblattman.com/2014/09/05/economist-read-suggesting-us-slavery-wasnt-always-bad/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">What The Economist should have read before suggesting that US slavery wasn't always so bad:</a> "Here’s the jawdropping finale: 'Slave owners surely had a vested interest in keeping their “hands” ever fitter and stronger to pick more cotton. Some of the rise in productivity could have come from better treatment. Unlike Mr Thomas, Mr Baptist has not written an objective history of slavery. Almost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains. This is not history; it is advocacy.' What could have shed light on this, had <em>The Economist</em> writer bothered to read?... Violence and pain work better in labor markets where people have really poor options, and are easily controlled, like children or the least educated. You see this in child labor during British industrialization, or even in child soldiering in Uganda.... Adults will tend to escape if you use violence, so slavery and serfdom work best when the overlords control the legal system or can hunt you down. You see this with servants in 19th century Britain or with European feudalism and US slavery. When you make it harder for employers to use force, wages go up. You see this in 19th century Puerto Rico coffee growing, or in the Emirates today. It’s not unusual to see a mix.... And when you turn the entire system against them, yes, whipped people work harder.... Suresh Naidu... yes, rewards can be a substitute for violence, but in a coercive labor market, better pay or food is just service to your larger evil plan to enslave more people more profitably.... Places in Peru and Bolivia with forced labor several hundred years ago are now poorer than other parts of the country.... Racially hostile attitudes also get passed down generation to generation in the US.... Is anyone else feeling depressed and hopeless?"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>djw:</strong> <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2014/09/predatory-broken-municipal-governments-st-louis-county">The predatory, broken municipal governments of St. Louis County:</a> "[Radley] Balko is doing some extraordinary and important work here: '"She was crying as I explained the situation to her", Voss says. "So then I started to cry as I explained it her. One of the really frustrating things about what’s happening here is that this system is breaking good people. These are people just trying to get by, just trying to take care of their families". Voss’s eyes well up as he talks about Bolden. This isn’t just an attorney defending his client. It’s a guy who is concerned about what’s happening to another human being. Bolden is a single black woman with four kids. She has several tattoos. It’s easy to see how cops might target her, or court officials might dismiss her. But Voss points out that she had already earned an associate’s degree in medical assistance. And while dealing with all of the arrests and the harassment, she earned another in paralegal studies. The Foristell warrant stemmed from a speeding ticket in 2011. As mentioned before, Bolden didn’t show up in court because she didn’t have the money to pay it and feared they’d put her jail. It’s a common and unfortunate misconception among St. Louis County residents, especially those who don’t have an attorney to tell them otherwise. A town can’t put you in jail for lacking the money to pay a fine. But you can be jailed not appearing in court to tell the judge you can’t pay.... While in jail, she missed a job interview. She fell behind in her paralegal studies. When she finally got her day in court, she was told to change out of her jail jumpsuit into the same clothes she had worn for three days straight, and that had been sitting in a bag for the previous two weeks.' It’s long, but read the whole thing. I confess I was actually surprised when the 'three outstanding warrants per household' in Ferguson fact first came to light; it’s now clear in St. Louis County, this is par for the course, and there are far worse examples–the extremely misleadingly named 'Country Club Hills' has 26 outstanding warrants per resident... a long piece filled with rage-inducing anecdotes.... In the short run, a democratic revival is clearly and badly needed, and one simply has to hope that perhaps this moment of sunshine on these governments will produce something of that sort..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kent Daniel and Tobias J. Moskowitz:</strong> <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w20439">Momentum Crashes:</a> "Despite their strong positive average returns across numerous asset classes, momentum strategies can experience infrequent and persistent strings of negative returns. These momentum crashes are partly forecastable. They occur in “panic” states – following market declines and when market volatility is high – and are contemporaneous with market rebounds. We show that the low ex-ante expected returns in panic states are consistent with a conditionally high premium attached to the option-like payoffs of past losers. An implementable dynamic momentum strategy based on forecasts of momentum’s mean and variance approximately doubles the alpha and Sharpe Ratio of a static momentum strategy, and is not explained by other factors. These results are robust across multiple time periods, international equity markets, and other asset classes."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Myles Udland:</strong> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/forgetful-investors-performed-best-2014-9">Fidelity Reviewed Which Investors Did Best And What They Found Was Hilarious:</a> "If you want good investment performance, forget you have an account.... O'Shaughnessy relays one anecdote from an employee who recently joined his firm that really makes your head spin. O'Shaughnessy: 'Fidelity had done a study as to which accounts had done the best at Fidelity. And what they found was...' Ritholtz: 'They were dead.' O'Shaughnessy: '...No, that's close though! They were the accounts people who forgot they had an account at Fidelity.'... Due to our behavioral biases, we often find ourselves buying high and selling low..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Robert Waldmann</strong> (2012): <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/08/depressing-graph-of-the-day-the-quasi-beveridge-curve.html">"Here we go a second time.</a> Neither the Beveridge curve nor the quasi-Beveridge curve show how much employment can increase without 'truly massive and successful public active labor market policies to better match workers to jobs'. It is more useful to look at the matching function showing hires as a function of vacancies and unemployed workers (or, to be quasi-, the peak minus the current employment to population ratio). If the matching function is stable, then the lowest sustainable unemployment rate is stable. However when there is a recession the Beveridge curve will show a huge ugly (as you graph it) clockwise pattern causing alarmed reports of worsened matching. It looked much worse in the UK in the late 90s just before the UK switched from being a high unemployment to low unemployment country."</p></li>

Economists... like simple stories... like effects that they understand... the idea that taxes are an incentive not to work is a simple, uncontroversial idea....But... if government programs are paying people not to work, then that should put upward pressure on real wages.... But when we look at the data, that’s not what we see happening.... When you break up the wage data by percentile, it looks even worse for the vacation thesis.... Economics 101 says that when the price of something and the quantity produced both fall, demand, not supply, has fallen. In America, the price of labor and the quantity of labor have both fallen and stayed low since 2009. That is a hint that the government’s welfare programs are having only a minimal impact on the number of Americans with jobs. Whatever caused us to stagnate for five years and counting, it probably wasn’t welfare.</p>

<p>Paul Krugman sums up what he thinks he knows and doesn't know:</p>

<p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/paul-krugman-the-deflation-caucus.html">The Deflation Caucus:</a> "Europe... is...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... in the grip of a deflationary vortex... [Its] central bank understands that. But its epiphany may have come too late.... And there but for the grace of Bernanke go we.... We seem (at least for now) to have steered clear of the kind of trap facing Europe. Why?... The Federal Reserve started doing the right thing years ago, buying trillions of dollars’ worth of bonds.... The Fed should have done even more. But Fed officials have faced fierce attacks all the way.... The predicted surge in inflation has never arrived, but despite being wrong year after year, hardly any of the critics have admitted being wrong, or even changed their tune. And the question I’ve been trying to answer is why. What is it that makes a powerful faction in our body politic--call it the deflation caucus--demand tight money even in a depressed, low-inflation economy?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...economists and policymakers were worried about a potential shift in the Beveridge curve.... Job vacancies were rising, but the unemployment rate was not declining, fueling a debate about a structural problem in the labor markets. Exactly four years ago, we... argued that it was too early to call what had happened a shift.... We concluded that the Beveridge curve behavior we were seeing in this recovery was typical of recoveries in general, and that the curve would likely follow its historical business-cycle pattern going forward, erasing any evidence of a shift. Well, four years later, we have 16 more quarterly data points to inform us.... It is safe to say that what seemed like a shift in the Beveridge curve ended up being another manifestation of the 'normal' dynamics of unemployment and vacancies in the United States...</p>

<h2>Basic Market Equilibrium Calculator--GGraph Version</h2>

<div id='background'>

<a name='background'><h3>Background</h3></a>

<p>Confronted with any competitive market supply and demand situation, you want immediately to know the answers to four questions:</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>What is the equilibrium price at which the commodity is sold?</li>
<li>What is the equilibrium quantity sold?</li>
<li>What is the consumer surplus--how much is the existence of the market worth to buyers collectively?</li>
<li>What is the producer surplus--how much is the existence of the market worth to the sellers collectively?</li>
</ol>

<p>If we are willing to assume linear demand and supply curves, we specify the behavior of demanders and suppliers with two parameters each:</p>

<ul>
<li>The maximum willingness-to-pay of the consumer who wants the commodity most.</li>
<li>The number of additional units bought for each $1 drop in the price.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum willingness-to-supply of the producer who can make the commodity cheapest.</li>
<li>The number of additional units sold for each $1 increase in the price.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Specify those four numbers under "basic conditions" below, click the "Solve the Model" button, and you will know what you need to know...</p>

<li><p><strong>Gerard Roland and Yuriy Gorodnichenko:</strong> <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/putin-s-endgame">Putin’s endgame:</a> "To Putin’s surprise, the Ukrainian government and army have put up serious resistance to his earlier moves. The level of popular support for his people’s republics in the East has also been surprisingly low.... The possible outcomes: (1) Ukraine continues fighting without any material help from the West.... (2) Ukraine continues fighting, the West radically tightens economic sanctions and gives more economic help to Ukraine.... (3) Ukraine continues fighting, the West radically tightens economic sanctions, gives more economic help to Ukraine, and provides military help. While Mr Putin has spent copious amounts of oil dollars to modernise the Russian army, it is no match for Western forces. Even if the West does not send troops to Ukraine and limits military support to supplies of weapons and intelligence, the Ukrainian forces will be able to have an upper hand in combat and it will be a matter of time before they retake the east of Ukraine.... It may take many thousands of lives on both sides before the war is over (scenario 1), or the war may end soon. The tally largely depends on the West’s policy response.... The West’s policy of appeasement has so far been utterly ineffective..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Daniel Kuehn:</strong> <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/importance-study-design-minimum-wage-debate/">Study Design and the Minimum-Wage Debate:</a> "Studies that match labor markets experiencing a minimum-wage increase with an appropriate comparison labor market... tend to find that minimum-wage increases have little or no effect on employment.... Studies that do not match labor markets experiencing a minimum-wage increase with a comparison labor market tend to find that minimum-wage increases reduce employment.... Labor market policy analysts strongly prefer studies that match 'treatment' with 'comparison' cases in a defensible way over studies that simply include controls and fixed effects in a regression model..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/dangerous-for-evil/">Dangerous for Evil:</a> "2009, when I was lamenting bad ideas from freshwater economists and Justin Fox was dismissing them as having no influence on policy.... It turned out that the bad ideas mattered a lot.... The Keynesian policy consensus... was fragile.... Republicans in the US, Germany, and the Trichet-era ECB were strongly anti-Keynesian by instinct. They were temporarily bowled over by the vocal Keynesian consensus... but were ready to grab hold of seemingly credentialed people willing to offer justifications for austerity and hard money. And a quorum of economists obliged. Alesina-Ardagna... good enough to give the austerians an intellectual fig leaf.... Reinhart-Rogoff and the 90 percent of doom. Having John Cochrane insist that Keynesian economics had been proved wrong and nobody was teaching it helped the austerian case even though it was completely untrue; so did having Robert Lucas accuse Christy Romer of being intellectually corrupt. Bad economic ideas didn’t really drive bad policy, but they acted as enablers for bad policy instincts. And the people who promulgated these bad ideas therefore have a lot to answer for."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jonathan Chait:</strong> <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/09/economist-denounces-one-sided-slavery-account.html">Economist Denounces One-Sided Slavery Account:</a> "<em>The Economist</em> reviews <em>The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism</em>, by Edward Baptist. Not having read the book, I cannot credibly assess it. I do have enough familiarity with the basic facts to know that The Economist's reviewer’s argument that the book is fatally biased seems a little... off: 'Mr Baptist has not written an objective history of slavery. Almost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains. This is not history; it is advocacy.' I can think of reasons other than ideological bias to explain why almost all the black people would be victims, and the white people villains, in a book about white people who captured black people and subjected them to torture, rape, murder, humiliation, and oppressive forced labor. Unless The Economist wants to suggest that there were overlooked cases of deserved slavery, it seems pretty intuitive that the black people are mostly going to be victims in a book about slavery. It also seems like the white people are inevitably not going to come off terribly well, either, in a book about slavery. Sure, there were plenty of white people who had nothing to do with slavery, but they may not feature so heavily in a book about slavery."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Richard Mayhew:</strong> <a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/2014/09/04/en-bancing-on-halbig/">En bancing on Halbig </a> "Noted a---- and Washington Post blogger Jonathan Adler’s quest to deny poor people the freedom of getting subsidized health insurance that could improve their well-being was dealt another blow... 'the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted rehearing en banc in Halbig v. Burwell....' Oral argument is scheduled for December 17.  In all likelihood, an opinion would not issue before mid-to-late Spring.... En banc rehearings only occur... to... re-affirm a high priority decision or to correct what the majority of that circuit believes to be a monumental f-----. Halbig is a monumental f-----. Vacating Halbig means there is no Circuit disagreement at this time, so the Supremes are highly unlikely to grant cert for the Oklahoma King case..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cosma Shalizi</strong> (2012): <a href="http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/925.html">No, Really, Some of My Best Friends Are Data Scientists:</a> "If, however, the name 'statistician' is avoided because that connotes not <em>a powerful discipline which transforms profound ideas about learning from experience into practical tools</em>, but, rather, <em>a meaningless conglomeration of rituals better conducted with twenty-sided dice</em>, then we as a profession have failed ourselves and, more importantly, the public, and the blame lies with us. Since what we have to offer is really quite wonderful, we should not let that happen."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Economist:</strong> <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21615482-how-slaves-built-american-capitalism-blood-cotton#sthash.g47VKaU5.dpbs">American slavery: Blood cotton:</a> "How slaves built American capitalism: Apology: In our review of <em>The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism</em> by Edward Baptist, we said: 'Mr Baptist has not written an objective history of slavery. Almost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains.' There has been widespread criticism of this, and rightly so. Slavery was an evil system, in which the great majority of victims were blacks, and the great majority of whites involved in slavery were willing participants and beneficiaries of that evil. We regret having published this and apologise for having done so. We are therefore withdrawing the review but in the interests of transparency, anybody who wants to see the withdrawn review can click here."</p></li>

				<p>From Barbara Tuchman: <em>The Guns of August:</em>*</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through France as through Belgium the Germans left a blackened and defiled path as they passed. Villages were burned, civilians shot, homes looted and torn, horses ridden through rooms, artillery wagons dragged across gardens, latrines dug in the family burial plot of the Poincarés at Nubécourt. Kluck’s IInd Corps passing through Senlis, twenty-five miles from Paris, on September 2, shot the Mayor and six other civilian hostages. A stone marker, just outside the town on the edge of a field where they are buried, bears their names: EUGÈNE ODÈNE Mayor EMILE AUBERT Tanner JEAN BARBIER Carter LUCIEN COTTREAU Café waiter PIERRE DEWERDT Chauffeur J-B.

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/1103.html">Class Announcement: 36-350, Statistical Computing, Fall 2014:</a> Fourth time is charm: <strong>Instructors:</strong> Yours truly and Andrew Thomas. <strong>Description:</strong> Computational data analysis is an essential part of modern statistics. Competent statisticians must not just be able to run existing programs, but to understand the principles on which they work. They must also be able to read, modify and write code, so that they can assemble the computational tools needed to solve their data-analysis problems, rather than distorting problems to fit tools provided by others. This class is an introduction to programming, targeted at statistics majors with minimal programming knowledge, which will give them the skills to grasp how statistical software works, tweak it to suit their needs, recombine existing pieces of code, and when needed create their own programs.... The class will be taught in the R language, use RStudio for labs, and R Markdown for assignments. <strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> This is an introduction to programming for statistics students. Prior exposure to statistical thinking, to data analysis, and to basic probability concepts is essential.... The class may be unbearably redundant for those who already know a lot about programming. The class will be utterly incomprehensible for those who do not know statistics and probability.</p>

<ol>
<li>One of the gems of the internet is Daniel Davies, now a retired country gentleman of leisure. Read him! <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ohhbhnt">http://tinyurl.com/ohhbhnt</a>. Plus: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pupf236">http://tinyurl.com/pupf236</a></li>
<li>You should be reading Jonathan Chait: America's Best, Most Substantive, and Most Accurate Center-Left Polemicist: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/k34h63l">http://tinyurl.com/k34h63l</a></li>
<li>You should be reading Sam Wang: he is providing more information about the race for senate control in a smaller space than others trying to do the modeling thing: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ml895zn">http://tinyurl.com/ml895zn</a></li>
<li>You should read the pick-up internet symposium "Why the Love of Hard Money?" that sprang into being this week: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/km9zmno">http://tinyurl.com/km9zmno</a>. And you should read my reflections five years ago--five years ago!--on Justin Fox's erroneous confidence that the good guys had the hard-money guys who hadn't done their homework on the run: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/oks6uhd">http://tinyurl.com/oks6uhd</a></li>
<li>If you live in the United States, you should start getting ready to see the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/qecsr7o">http://tinyurl.com/qecsr7o</a></li>
<li><img alt="" align="right" src="http://delong.typepad.com/.a/6a00e551f08003883401b7c6cfc198970b-pi" width="275" />Clinging tight to Naive Keynesianism is the only way to have a chance of understanding the macroeconomy these days: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pev5g3c">http://tinyurl.com/pev5g3c</a> </li>
<li>The principal obstacle to American prosperity springing from the blue states: rampant NIMBYism: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/lj4s6n5">http://tinyurl.com/lj4s6n5</a> | <a href="http://tinyurl.com/o54gc49">http://tinyurl.com/o54gc49</a></li>
<li>Among all the nations of the North Atlantic, Americans are uniquely deluded about the state of inequality in their country: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/mp6b352">http://tinyurl.com/mp6b352</a>. I do know that one of the most important features of American exceptionalism is that Americans by and large regard themselves not as working people oppressed by The Man, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires. But this is absurd.</li>
<li>It's no longer <strike>The Financial Crisis</strike> or <strike>The Great Recession</strike>. It's now the Lesser Depression. And in five years it will no longer be <strike>The Lesser Depression</strike> but instead we will call it: The Greater Depression: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/lazmtfn">http://tinyurl.com/lazmtfn</a> | <a href="http://tinyurl.com/md6sw6v">http://tinyurl.com/md6sw6v</a></li>
<li>From 1914: The War on Belgium: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/k7yswhy">http://tinyurl.com/k7yswhy</a> | <a href="http://tinyurl.com/lqfbg7a">http://tinyurl.com/lqfbg7a</a> | <a href="http://tinyurl.com/l9mrvhb">http://tinyurl.com/l9mrvhb</a>. The remarkable speed with which the Kaiser's Germans in 1914 began the wholesale massacre of Belgians is the most powerful piece of evidence that German culture needed to experience the fire and death of 1914-1918 and 1942-1945 in order to even begin creating the possibility of a German national state that would be a good neighbor.</li>
<li>Part of the more than two-century struggle of Artemas Ward and his descendants to try to get the American people to recognize that John Adams may not have been so clever after all when he decided to try to rope Virginia into the revolutionary cause by superseding Artemas Ward and his Massachusetts officers who had built the American army with a Virginia worthy whose military record in the Seven Years' War had been, to put it very, very politely, most undistinguished: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/mngoh3y">http://tinyurl.com/mngoh3y</a> | <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ofovszu">http://tinyurl.com/ofovszu</a></li>
<li>Haruspicy, or perhaps plastromancy, as to why long-term interest rates have not yet begun to "normalize" to whatever the new normal is going to be: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/n8ktz7y">http://tinyurl.com/n8ktz7y</a></li>
<li>Agent-based models are the future of good economic theory, and will always be such--until we enter the New Jerusalem where we have the computer power to run real simulations and the brain power to understand how to thick about the emergent properties such real simulations produce. Maranatha! Rajiv Sethi is very worthy reading: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/k3klbo7">http://tinyurl.com/k3klbo7</a></li>

<li><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/money-in-a-time-of-zero/">Money in a Time of Zero:</a> "People who spend too much time... [saying] monetary policy doesn’t matter.... Contractionary monetary policy is working just fine; all the central banks that mistakenly decided that it was time to raise rates... [are now] realizing their error and reversing course. But what about the fact that vast increases in the monetary base have failed to do much to the economy?... The irrelevance of the monetary base is... something that happens when you’re in a liquidity trap.... I get annoyed both by people who declare that nobody could have predicted the failure of balance-sheet expansion to cause inflation, and by those who claim that conventional economists like me just don’t understand that money is endogenous. Guys, I laid it all out 16 years ago. And as for the idea that the absence of a clear definition of money, plus the fact that most money is created by financial institutions, means that central banks don’t matter, James Tobin dealt with all that more than fifty years ago.... If you think something deeply disturbing from an analytical perspective has taken place... you basically weren’t paying attention. If you read your Tobin... [and what] Woodford and I had to say about the liquidity trap, you expected to see exactly what we’re seeing."</p></li>

They can do this effectively by strengthening their states’ earned income tax credits (EITCs) and minimum wages.  EITCs and the minimum wage are twin pillars of making work pay for families that earn low wages.... Strengthening either... will boost incomes for low-wage working families, but these policy improvements are particularly effective in combination..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Martin Wolf:</strong> <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/152ccd58-3294-11e4-93c6-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=published_links/rss/comment_columnists_martin-wolf/feed//product&amp;siteedition=intl#axzz3CHerUSK3">Financial reform: Call to arms:</a> "The financial crises and the years of economic malaise that followed represent profound failures of the economy and of policy. Above all, they were failures of understanding.... In retrospect, the insouciance of policy makers about the risks being run seems terrifying. But this also raises a big question now: have they learnt the right lessons for the future?... The target of monetary policy is to keep inflation low and stable, though some central banks (notably the Fed) explain that the aim is the highest level of activity subject to hitting its inflation target.... The financial sector is also to remain broadly the same as before, albeit vastly more tightly regulated and with somewhat higher capital requirements. There is also to be enhanced oversight of the systemic fragility of the financial system under the rubric of macroprudential policy. This new orthodoxy is merely a chastened version of the old. But is it workable?... There are a number of reasons for believing the answer is no First, policy makers rely overwhelmingly on monetary policy as the stabilisation instrument of choice. But monetary policy works via asset prices and credit expansion. This combination certainly risks a repeat of crises.... Second, experience shows that the low inflation targets to which policy makers are committed are not high enough to ensure short-term interest rates can remain above zero in all circumstances.... Third, potential exists for conflict between monetary policy on the one hand and macroprudential policy on the other.... The new regulatory regime is an astonishingly complex response to the failures of this model. But 'keep it simple, stupid' is as good a rule in regulation as it is in life. The sensible solution seems clear: force banks to fund themselves with equity.... A shift away from over-reliance on inflexible debt contracts, with all the fragility they create in the economy, would require complementary policy changes. The existing favourable tax treatment of debt needs to be ended.... The pre-crisis orthodoxy proved defective. The new orthodoxy is an improvement. But it is open to question in important respects. The financial system remains fragile. The risks of further crises are not small. Far greater ambition is needed."</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>...They can do this effectively by strengthening their states’ earned income tax credits (EITCs) and minimum wages.  EITCs and the minimum wage are twin pillars of making work pay for families that earn low wages.... Strengthening either... will boost incomes for low-wage working families, but these policy improvements are particularly effective in combination..."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even as German forces retreated in the east and the west, the Nazi extermination camps were as busy as ever. Trains were still being sent from all round Europe, taking Jews to their deaths. On the 4th September 1944 Anne Frank and her family were stuck in a cattle car somewhere in Germany, en route to Auschwitz from the Netherlands. Inside Auschwitz a small but very significant act of rebellion was taking place. The special squad of prisoners who worked in the gas chambers were smuggling out some pictures of the death camp in action. The ‘Sonderkammando’s duties included sorting out the huge quantities of victims’ property – it is very likely that the camera was acquired in this process. The pictures were snatched covertly. This was the subsequent account of Alter Fajnzylberg:</p>

The bad actors had a great deal of influence on policy after September 2009…</p>

<p>From the archives: five years ago:</p>

<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/09/krugman-fox-mccain-prescott-and-company.html">Brad DeLong : Krugman, Fox, McCain, Prescott, and Company</a>: Justin Fox:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paul Krugman tells how economists got it all wrong: the one big issue I have with the piece is that, while economists certainly got lots of things wrong before the crisis (as did almost all of us), many members of the profession have acquitted themselves pretty well since things turned really ugly last year. Krugman goes on and on about the "freshwater" economists (at the Universities of Chicago, Rochester and Minnesota) and their crazy ideas about perfect markets. But what's telling is that the hardcore freshwaterites have had almost no impact on economic policy for the past year—neither in the Bush months or the Obama ones. Sure, Nobelist Ed Prescott, a former freshwater economist who now teaches in Phoenix and thus should probably be described as a no-water economist, made the statement that:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>"I don't know why Obama said all economists agree on [the need for a stimulus bill]," Prescott said. "They don't. If you go down to the third-tier schools, yes, but they're not the people advancing the science."</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Unless you believe that pretty much anyplace other than Arizona State University is a third-tier school, this is patently untrue, evidence of the extreme isolation of the remaining true believers in rational expectations and real business cycles and other such elegant but profoundly unhelpful macroeconomic theories developed since the 1960s.</p>

Jacques Rueff.... Friedman was realistic enough to understand that one could not reason with von Mises.... Instead, his strategy was to say that there is only one kind of real gold standard....

When asked why, Taylor declined to comment and says he “would do some press later in the week.” This decision comes after it was announced Wednesday morning that Independent U.S. Senate candidate Greg Orman had been endorsed by a group of former moderate Republicans in the Kansas Legislature who are unhappy with the state GOP’s conservative leanings...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...that followed represent profound failures of the economy and of policy. Above all, they were failures of understanding.... In retrospect, the insouciance of policy makers about the risks being run seems terrifying. But this also raises a big question now: have they learnt the right lessons for the future?... The target of monetary policy is to keep inflation low and stable, though some central banks (notably the Fed) explain that the aim is the highest level of activity subject to hitting its inflation target.... The financial sector is also to remain broadly the same as before, albeit vastly more tightly regulated and with somewhat higher capital requirements. There is also to be enhanced oversight of the systemic fragility of the financial system under the rubric of macroprudential policy.</p>
  
  <p>This new orthodoxy is merely a chastened version of the old. But is it workable?... There are a number of reasons for believing the answer is no First, policy makers rely overwhelmingly on monetary policy as the stabilisation instrument of choice. But monetary policy works via asset prices and credit expansion. This combination certainly risks a repeat of crises.... Second, experience shows that the low inflation targets to which policy makers are committed are not high enough to ensure short-term interest rates can remain above zero in all circumstances.... Third, potential exists for conflict between monetary policy on the one hand and macroprudential policy on the other.... </p>
  
  <p>The new regulatory regime is an astonishingly complex response to the failures of this model. But 'keep it simple, stupid' is as good a rule in regulation as it is in life. The sensible solution seems clear: force banks to fund themselves with equity.... A shift away from over-reliance on inflexible debt contracts, with all the fragility they create in the economy, would require complementary policy changes. The existing favourable tax treatment of debt needs to be ended.... The pre-crisis orthodoxy proved defective. The new orthodoxy is an improvement. But it is open to question in important respects. The financial system remains fragile. The risks of further crises are not small. Far greater ambition is needed.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My belief from 2003-2007 that the serious threat to the American financial system came from universal banks that had used their derivatives books to sell lots of unhedged puts against the dollar rather than universal banks accepting lots of house-value puts without doing any due diligence about the quality of the underlying assets.</p></li>
<li><p>My fear from 2008-2010 that although nominal wages were downward-sticky they were not that downward-sticky and we were on the point of tipping over into absolute deflation.</p></li>
<li><p>My confidence in 2009-2010 that the major policymakers--Bernanke, Obama, and what turned out to be Geithner--both understood how to use the ample monetary, fiscal, banking, and housing finance tools at their disposal to effectively target nominal GDP and understood the urgency of doing whatever it took to return nominal GDP to its pre-2008 growth path.</p></li>
<li><p>My failure to even conceive that "Washington" starting in 2010 could possibly be sufficiently happy with the pace of recovery that serious measures to further boost demand would vanish from the agenda.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(1) and (2) and (3) I have written about elsewhere. Today we have a piece of (4) to deal with--why do so many people prioritize low-pressure economy policies that they regard as the only safeguard of hard money over economic recovery? Paul Krugman constitutes himself the <em>συμποσιαρχ</em>, decides that we will be drinking <em>κρασί ακρατος</em>, and poses the question: <a href="http://equitablegrowth.ms.techprogress.org/?p=6288"><strong>READ MOAR</strong></a></p>

				<p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/money-in-a-time-of-zero/">Money in a Time of Zero:</a> "People who spend too much time...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...[saying] monetary policy doesn’t matter.... Contractionary monetary policy is working just fine; all the central banks that mistakenly decided that it was time to raise rates... [are now] realizing their error and reversing course. But what about the fact that vast increases in the monetary base have failed to do much to the economy?... The irrelevance of the monetary base is... something that happens when you’re in a liquidity trap.... I get annoyed both by people who declare that nobody could have predicted the failure of balance-sheet expansion to cause inflation, and by those who claim that conventional economists like me just don’t understand that money is endogenous. Guys, I laid it all out 16 years ago. And as for the idea that the absence of a clear definition of money, plus the fact that most money is created by financial institutions, means that central banks don’t matter, James Tobin dealt with all that more than fifty years ago.... If you think something deeply disturbing from an analytical perspective has taken place... you basically weren’t paying attention. If you read your Tobin... [and what] Woodford and I had to say about the liquidity trap, you expected to see exactly what we’re seeing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We drove on, liberating town after town, village after village, and we were madly cheered on our way. Some of the places we went through had been occupied by the Germans less than ten hours ago. The excitement was intense! The journey across the battlefields of 1914-18 was most interesting — the Somme, Arras, Vimy Ridge.</p>
  
  <p>The whole of that area is now fertile farming land, peaceful and beautiful and it is ghastly to imagine that thirty years ago, those fields were littered with the smashed bodies of good men. Their bones ploughed into the earth by shell-fire! No wonder the soil is fertile. Along the route we passed a number of war cemeteries, housing their wasted dead, and they were a vivid reminder of the futility of war. The Canadian memorial on Vimy Ridge looked most impressive.</p>

<p>We started by calling it the financial crisis of 2007. Then it became the financial crisis of 2008. Next it was the downturn of 2009-2009. By the middle of 2009 it was clearly the biggest thing since the 1930s, and acquired the name of "The Great Recession". By the end of 2009 the business cycle trough had been passed, and people breathed a sigh of relief: "The Great Recession" would be its stable name--we would not have to change its name again, and move on to labels containing the D-word. <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/j--bradford-delong-argues-that-it-is-time-to-call-what-is-happening-in-europe-and-the-us-by-its-true-name"><strong>READ MOAR at Project Syndicate</strong></a> <a href="http://equitablegrowth.org/2014/08/28/start-calling-greater-depression-early-friday-focus-august-29-2014/">READ MOAR at Equitable Growth:</a> </p>
