<p>Mojang makes it official:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you might already know, Notch is the creator of Minecraft and
the majority shareholder at Mojang. He’s decided that he doesn’t
want the responsibility of owning a company of such global
significance. Over the past few years he’s made attempts to work
on smaller projects, but the pressure of owning Minecraft became
too much for him to handle. The only option was to sell Mojang.
He’ll continue to do cool stuff though. Don’t worry about that.</p>

<p>There are only a handful of potential buyers with the resources to
grow Minecraft on a scale that it deserves. We’ve worked closely
with Microsoft since 2012, and have been impressed by their
continued dedication to our game and its development. We’re
confident that Minecraft will continue to grow in an awesome way.</p>

<p>My thanks to Pixate for once again sponsoring the DF RSS feed. With Pixate, mobile designers can craft sophisticated animations and interactions for any form factor. You can already start designing for new displays like those on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and they   re already working on support for the Apple Watch. And here   s the thing: Pixate generates 100 percent native iOS (and Android) prototypes. Native code, not web views.</p>

<p>They have a special deal just for DF readers: <a href="http://www.pixate.com?r=df2">Sign up now</a> to get on the waiting list and you   ll get a free month when Pixate launches.</p>

<p>Rich Mogull, writing for Macworld:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But aside from the technical differences, Apple is in a unique
position due to its business model. It doesn’t want or need to
track transactions. It doesn’t want or need to be the payment
processor. It isn’t restricted by carrier agreements, since it
fully controls the hardware. Google, although first to the market
by a matter of years, is still hamstrung by device manufacturers
and carriers. Softcard is hamstrung by the usual greed and idiocy
of mobile phone providers. PayPal has no footprint on devices.</p>

<p>This is a long-term investment by Apple, and possibly one of the
most important since it first built the iTunes Store. Apple is
putting its muscle behind <em>improving the user experience of making
payments</em>, and using that to sell more devices. It won’t make
much directly from Apple Pay now. But as more people use supported
devices and push more merchants to support the user experience,
odds are that those small per-transaction fees will grow into a
significant source of revenue.</p>

<p>I spent over an hour trying to order from the online Apple Store (4.7-inch, space gray, 128 GB) to no avail. The closest I got was a properly configured phone but a disabled  8220 Add to Cart 8221  button.</p>

<p>Gave up, went to the Verizon website, and successfully ordered there. I think. Verizon   s website is almost spectacularly convoluted and ugly as sin.</p>

<p>You   d think after eight years Apple would be able to deal with this. No surprise demand is high  8212  the iPhones 6 are amazing, and bigger displays have been long-awaited  8212  but the online store crapping itself so utterly is just embarrassing.</p>

<p>Horace Dediu:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As in the Revolutionary User Interface story,  the symmetry in approach to the launch is telling, but what I want to note is that the three things which the iPhone was defined as being are no longer things that it is most used for.</p>

<p>Yes, the iPhone is still a wide-screen iPod which gets plenty of use but I don’t think anyone thinks that is a defining feature. It’s also a phone, but the Phone is just an app which, for me at least, is not frequently used. I communicate with my iPhone but the go-to app is iMessage or FaceTime or Skype or maybe Email or Twitter. Phone is something I use so rarely that the interface sometimes baffles me. And yes, it’s an Internet appliance. Browsing is something I do quite a bit but many of the browsing jobs-to-be-done are done better by apps. News, shopping Facebook and maps are “things which were once done in a browser.”</p>

<p>So I wonder whether the tentpole product-defining anchors used to introduce the Apple Watch will be faintly amusing a few years from now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Timekeeping and fitness tracking, I don   t know. Those could fade in importance after we get a rich ecosystem of apps. But communication seems key to the Apple Watch concept  8212  it   s the only feature other than the home screen with a dedicated hardware button.</p>

<p>Derek Willis, writing for the NYT:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The “Custom Managed Audiences” tool works like this: A
campaign or group uses its own list of potential voters (or buys
one from a state authority or private vendor) and uploads it to
Facebook. The company then matches the names to its user base
through databases managed by companies, such as Acxiom, that
specialize in collecting information about individuals. This
process effectively combines the electoral information it already
knows about voters with their Facebook profiles: likes, group
memberships, issues or even favorites. The process anonymizes the
users’ personal identifiers but retains enough information to
enable campaigns to target well-defined groups.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I   m not even sure we can call it a watch. Okay, it goes on the
wrist, and it happens to tell the time, but that   s about where the
similarities between Apple   s just announced watch and the
hand-assembled, often painstakingly finished mechanical watches we
write about, and obsess over, end. I was lucky enough to be
invited to Cupertino to witness the announcement of the Apple
Watch firsthand, and though I do not believe it poses any threat
to haute horology manufactures, I do think the Apple Watch will be
a big problem for low-priced quartz watches, and even some
entry-level mechanical watches. In years to come, it could pose a
larger threat to higher end brands, too. The reason? Apple got
more details right on their watch than the vast majority of
Swiss and Asian brands do with similarly priced watches, and those
details add up to a really impressive piece of design. It
offers so much more functionality than other digitals it   s
almost embarrassing. But it   s not perfect, by any means. Read on
to hear my thoughts on the Apple Watch, from the perspective of a
watch guy.</p>

<p>Here   s what I expect. Two new iPhones, one 4.7 inches, the other 5.5. Same internal specs on both  8212  same A8 SoC, same cameras, same guts. The only difference will be the screen (and the software implications that result from it). I think <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/08/larger_iphone_display_conjecture">my predictions on display resolutions</a> from a few weeks ago are still looking good: </p>

<ul>
<li>4.7-inch display: 1334 × 750, 326 PPI @2x</li>
<li>5.5-inch display: 2208 × 1242, 461 PPI @3x</li>
</ul>

<p>(More on that @2x/@3x difference in a moment.)</p>

<p>I think the 5.5-inch model will have a starting price $100 higher, and that the new iPhone lineup will look like this (based on U.S. subsidized prices, with two-year carrier contracts):</p>

<ul>
<li>New 5.5-inch iPhone: $299/ 9/499</li>
<li>New 4.7-inch iPhone: $199/299/ 9</li>
<li>iPhone 5S: $99</li>
<li>iPhone 5C:  8220 free 8221 </li>
</ul>

<p>I suspect now the whole point of the iPhone 5C was to get to this point, where the plastic iPhone and the  8220 free 8221  iPhone are one and the same. Next year, I wouldn   t expect the 5S to move down to  8220 free 8221   instead, I would expect an iPhone 5CS  8212  a 5C-style plastic iPhone with 5S internals and features (like Touch ID).</p>

<p>I   m hoping that all storage tiers get doubled  8212  that the  8220 free 8221  phone goes from 8 to 16 GB, the $99 one from 16/32 to 32/64, and the two new ones go from 16/32/64 to 32/64/128.</p>

<p>There   s a catch, I suspect, with the 5.5-inch one. There have been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=5.5%20inch%20iphone%20is%20delayed&amp gws_rd=ssl">pervasive rumors for months</a> that the 5.5-inch iPhone was lagging the 4.7-inch one in production. Many of these rumors even claimed the 5.5-inch one would be announced later, or, if announced alongside the 4.7-inch one, that the 5.5-inch one would not go on sale until later in the year or maybe even next year. That makes no marketing sense, though. Apple isn   t going to announce a new iPhone in September that doesn   t go on sale until December or January.</p>

<p>Today comes a report that <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/08/55-iphone-6-said-to-launch-in-limited-quantities-on-sept-19-alongside-47-model">both phones will launch on September 19</a> (the same date relative to the announcement  8212  the Friday a week and a half after the announcement event  8212  as with all previous fall iPhone releases). That makes perfect product marketing sense, but it doesn   t jibe with the pervasive reports that it   s behind in production.</p>

<p>We can square this circle pretty easily. My guess is that both phones will go on sale, officially, at the same time, but that the 5.5-inch model will be in short supply initially  8212  perhaps severely short supply. In short, the 5.5-inch iPhone might be this year   s gold iPhone 5S  8212  very hard to get for the first few months.</p>

<p>Why change the  8220 regular 8221  size from 4.0 to 4.7 inches? I don   t know  I   m willing to keep an open mind until I see one in person tomorrow that it   ll be an improvement without being much of an imposition  8212  that the device as a whole won   t feel that much bigger volumetrically and the increase in screen real estate will be a welcome improvement.</p>

<p>Why introduce a second size class, at the relatively enormous (for a phone) 5.5 inches? Two reasons, very clear to me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Some people want to buy them. It doesn   t matter why. For some it might be games. For others, being able to carry one device as a hybrid phone/tablet. For others, it might be about reading  8212  making the iPhone more usable as an e-book reader. It doesn   t matter what the reasons are. The simple fact is that many people want huge phones  8212  not just bigger ones, but huge ones  8212  and they   re willing to pay a premium for them. Apple has played a one-size-fits-all game for seven iPhone generations. The market shows that one size does not fit all. I don   t know that they should have done it sooner, but it certainly <em>feels</em> like the time for multiple iPhone sizes has come.</p></li>
<li><p>Battery life. Giant-sized phones have room for giant-sized batteries.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For people interested in reason 1  8212  those who want a 5.5-inch iPhone <em>because</em> of the large screen  8212  reason number 2 is just icing on the cake. They   ll get the phone for the display size, and enjoy the longer battery life as a side benefit.</p>

<p>For people interested primarily in reason 2, though, it might be a mixed bag. What if the 4.7-inch iPhone gets the same  8220 10 hours of talk time 8221  battery life as previous iPhones, and the 5.5-inch iPhone gets, say, 18 or even 20 hours? There are going to be people who will buy the 5.5-inch iPhone <em>despite</em> the size of the device, not <em>because</em> of it, just because of the battery life. It   s for these people that I think Apple will indeed have a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/09/07/one-handed-nerfherder">one-handed mode</a> that shrinks the UI.</p>

<h2>Legacy Apps on the New iPhone Displays</h2>

<p>How will existing apps that have not been updated to support iOS 8 adaptive layout and multiple display sizes render on-screen on the 4.7- and 5.5-inch iPhones? Zoomed to fill the screen, I say.</p>

<p>I know, when the iPhone 5 changed the aspect ratio from 3:2 to 16:9, existing apps ran letterboxed, with black bars at the top and bottom. But you can   t scale to accommodate an aspect ratio change. (Well, you could, but it would be gross.) You <em>can</em> scale to accommodate a size change with the same aspect ratio. Those apps will look a little blurry, but they   ll look better than they would in the middle of a black box on all four sides. Think back to when the iPhone first went retina  8212  old apps ran pixel-doubled. That looked <em>way</em> worse than current apps will scaled to the 4.7- and 5.5-inch displays.</p>

<p>Plus, people who just spent hundreds of dollars on a huge new iPhone don   t want to see tiny apps. </p>

<h2>Why I Think Only the 5.5-inch iPhone Will Go to @3x Retina</h2>

<p>The bigger battery also explains, partially, why I project that the 5.5-inch, and <em>only</em> the 5.5-inch, iPhone will get a super-high resolution screen (461 PPI, I   m guessing, give or take a pixel or two per inch) and will run at @3x retina resolution. More pixels consume more power. Joshua Ho, in an excellent piece for AnandTech earlier this year,  8220 <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/7743/the-pixel-density-race-and-its-technical-merits">The Pixel Density Race and Its Technical Merits</a> 8221 :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For both OLED and LCD displays, pushing higher pixel densities
incurs a cost in the form of greater power consumption for a given
luminance value. Going from around 330 PPI to 470 PPI for an LCD
IPS display incurs around a 20% power draw increase on the
display, which can be offset by more efficient SoC, larger
batteries, improved RF subsystem power draw.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Battery life aside, sure, @3x retina would be just as great on a 4.7-inch iPhone as on a 5.5-inch iPhone. But we can   t leave battery life aside  8212  it   s an essential factor that guides all design decisions. I suspect an @3x 4.7-inch iPhone today, in 2014, would get unacceptable battery life  8212  perhaps worse than the battery life of the iPhone 5S. That 20 percent power draw increase would be too much for its battery.</p>

<p>The 5.5-inch iPhone has room for a battery that is <em>way</em> bigger than the one in the 4.7. <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/08/video-5-5-inch-iphone-6-battery-2915-mah/">According to purported supply chain leaks</a>, about 50 percent bigger. So it can provide energy for the power-hungry 461 PPI display <em>and</em> still have plenty left over to give the large iPhone unprecedented (at least for iPhones) battery life in real-world usage.</p>

<p>Also, consider that the super-high resolution display might be one of the reasons that the 5.5-inch model is supposedly lagging the 4.7-inch one in production. If those displays are constrained, it   d be far worse if both new phones used them, rather than just one. (I suspect the 4.7-inch phone uses a 326 PPI display, exactly the same pixel density as the retina iPad Mini and all retina iPhones to date.)</p>

<h2>The Wrist Wearable Thing</h2>

<p>I don   t know if it   s a watch. But as we get closer, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/fashion/intel-and-opening-ceremony-collaborate-on-mica-a-stylish-tech-bracelet.html">everyone</a> is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/iwatch-battery-life-2014-9">saying</a> it   s a watch. So for the sake of clarity I   ll call it a watch here, but I want my Being Right Points if it winds up being something that goes on your wrist but isn   t a watch.</p>

<p>If it has a screen, I   ll bet it   s square. And if it   s square, 320 8201  215  8201 320 pixels sounds about right to me. But here   s the thing I don   t understand: LCD screens are power-hungry. Watch batteries are necessarily tiny. I don   t see how a watch with a 320 8201  215  8201 320 display could get acceptable battery life, unless the screen is almost never on. And if the screen is almost never on, how is it a watch?</p>

<p>Perhaps even if they use the word  8220 watch 8221 , it may no more be a <em>watch</em> in the traditional sense of the word than the iPhone is a <em>phone</em> in the traditional sense.<sup id="fnr1-2014-09-08"><a href="#fn1-2014-09-08">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Everyone else has gone skeuomorphic. The Moto 360 is earning kudos for being the Android Wear device that most resembles a traditional watch. Motorola explicitly states that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/25/5843028/up-close-with-the-moto-360-the-best-looking-smartwatch-yet">this is why they based it on a circular design</a>. The Moto 360 watch faces are mostly skeuomorphic  they mimic the look of analog watch faces. That sort of mimicry of real-world analog objects is exactly what Apple has just spent the last two years <em>eliminating</em> in iOS and OS X. I expect Apple to go some other way. I   ll be very disappointed if this is just a device that shows a fake analog watch face, displays notifications from a tethered iPhone, and tracks your footsteps and heart rate.</p>

<p>In short, I don   t expect to see Apple   s take on the sort of thing Android Wear is trying to do. I expect Apple to do something different, and quite possibly something <em>less</em> but deeper.</p>

<p>And whatever it is, I think it will be controversial. Perhaps it will be <a href="http://bgr.com/2014/09/01/apple-iwatch-pricing-400-dollars/">expensive</a>. Perhaps it will have far, far fewer features than do Android Wear devices. Perhaps it will appear <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/The-Problem-with-Apple-s-Juice">under-powered</a> at first.</p>

<p>But there will be something, or several somethings, that will cause it to be misunderstood by those who are only able to frame new creations in the context of what came before them. Apple   s watch won   t fit in an existing mold. It won   t be a phone on your wrist. It won   t be a watch as we know it. We already have excellent phones. We already have excellent watches. For the Apple watch to be worth creating, it must be excellent at something else.</p>

<p>(What if it   s a revolutionary iPod  8212  with an  8220 o 8221 ? An iPod whose form factor is naturally meant to just get out of the way while you wear it, including when you wear it to exercise. <a href="http://www.volleythat.com/why-not-combinator-podcast/2014/9/8/iwatch-for-runners">Max Child imagined just that, it sounds like something a lot of people would buy</a>. I would. And it would fit with both the  8220 health 8221  angle of fitness tracking sensors and HealthKit in iOS 8, and Apple   s traditional September  8220 <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/u2-said-to-play-role-at-apple-event/">music event</a> 8221 .) &nbsp <a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Prelude to Tomorrow’s Big-Ass iPhone Apple Event’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/09/prelude"> 9733 </a></p>

<p>Sounds exactly right to me. The thing is, Apple practically telegraphed this sort of thing in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/">Session 216 at WWDC this year</a> ( 8220 Building Adaptive Apps with UIKit 8221 ). The key to understanding it is that it   s not running an iPad app layout on an iPhone, but rather running an iPad-<em>like</em> layout. It   s not like with the iPad Air and Mini where you have the same layout at different scales. It   s an adaptive layout, where the scale remains the same as a regular iPhone, but the extra space on the big iPhone, in landscape, is used to show multiple columns.</p>

  <p>While we don’t have much of an idea what the coveted iWatch will
look like, I was able to glean one small detail from people at
Apple who work on the company’s wearables.</p>

<p>According to a designer who works at Apple, Jonathan Ive, Apple’s
design chief, in bragging about how cool he thought the iWatch was
shaping up to be, gleefully said Switzerland is in trouble  8212 
though he chose a much bolder term for “trouble” to express how he
thought the watchmaking nation might be in a tough predicament
when Apple’s watch comes out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the build-up to the new Apple Watch, it is easy to get seduced
by the rumored features. Curved screen! Wireless charging! Jony
Ive thinks it’s slick!</p>

<p>But  8212  and I hate to burst everyone’s bubble here  8212  the appeal of
the world’s most highly anticipated wearable computer is going to
come down to something a lot more mundane: battery life.</p>

<p>And I have some bad news. I think it is going to be disappointing.
People who have talked to Apple about the watch said that Apple
employees have set low expectations. Maybe it’s Apple sandbagging.
Maybe the battery life really is bad. We’ll learn more on Tuesday
at the big unveiling and, eventually, when it ships next year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If true, and it   s really a  8220 watch 8221 , that   s a problem. If it   s something more like a wearable iPod Nano, maybe not so much. But Lessin is saying it   s a watch.</p>

<p>Daisuke Wakabayashi, writing for the WSJ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In his first interview on the subject, Apple Chief Executive Tim
Cook said celebrities    iCloud accounts were compromised when
hackers correctly answered security questions to obtain their
passwords, or when they were victimized by a phishing scam to
obtain user IDs and passwords.</p>

<p>He said none of the Apple IDs and passwords leaked from the
company   s servers.</p>

<p>To make such leaks less likely, Mr. Cook said Apple will alert
users via email and push notifications when someone tries to
change an account password, restore iCloud data to a new device,
or when a device logs into an account for the first time.</p>

<p>Until now, users got an email when someone tried to change a
password or log in for the first time from an unknown Apple
device  there were no notifications for restoring iCloud data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That Cook would take time this week, in the run-up to Tuesday   s event, to address this says to me he   s taking it pretty damn seriously.</p>

  <p>And the problem for women like me, with thin wrists, is that the
watch may sound small  8212  1.8 inches in diameter and just a
half-inch thick  8212  but it almost looks like I grabbed a clock off
the wall and strapped it to my arm.</p>

<p>Of course, size wasn   t an issue for everyone who tried it on. It
looked decent on my father   s medium-size wrist, and just right on
my co-worker   s extra-large one.</p>

<p>Motorola says it is working on smaller versions, but that makes me
concerned about battery life: Even this big, honking model had to
be charged twice a day. Most days, after charging it overnight, I
had to put it back on its wireless charging cradle by 4 p.m. If
only the large black circle could also work as a sundial so I
could still tell the time when the battery dies.</p>

<p>So it   s way too big for at least half the population and has to be charged twice a day.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<h6 class="dateline">Wednesday,  3 September 2014</h6>

<p>The single-worst piece I   ve seen regarding last week   s iCloud celebrity photo leak is, by far, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/09/celebrity_photo_hack_blame_apple_for_its_disregard_for_user_security.html">this one from David Auerbach at Slate</a>. To see where Auerbach is coming from, let   s skip ahead to his conclusion first:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But whether or not any of these problems were directly responsible
for the leak, Apple users, from Jennifer Lawrence to corporate
executives to laptop musicians to you, should be out for blood,
and other companies should use this as a lesson to double- and
triple-check their own security stories. Apple will probably
survive though. IPhones [<em>sic</em>] are so cool and pretty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The old  8220 Apple customers are shallow fools drawn to shiny things, and easily swayed by popular opinion 8221  angle.</p>

<p>Here   s the problem with Auerbach   s piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether or not this particular vulnerability was used to gather
some of the photos  8212  Apple is not commenting, as usual, but the
ubiquity and popularity of Apple’s products certainly point to the
iCloud of being a likely source  8212  its existence is reason enough
for users to be deeply upset at their beloved company for not
taking security seriously enough. Here are five reasons why you
should not trust Apple with your nude photos or, really, with any
of your data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don   t trust Apple  8220 with any of your data 8221  isn   t just wrong because it   s a hyperbolic overreaction, it   s wrong because it   s potentially dangerous. What has been mostly overlooked in the reaction to this photo leak scandal, and completely lost in Auerbach   s argument, is that <em>backups are a form of security</em>  8212  in the same sense that life insurance is a form of security for your children and spouse.</p>

<p>Over the years I   ve received numerous emails from past and former Genius Bar support staff, telling similar stories of heartbreak. Customer comes in, their iPhone completely broken, or lost, or stolen, and they had precious photos and videos on it. The birth of a child. The last vacation they ever took with a beloved spouse who has since passed away. Did they ever back up their iPhone to a Mac or PC with iTunes? No. In many cases they don   t even know what  8220 iTunes on a PC 8221  even means. Or maybe they connected the iPhone to iTunes once, the day they bought it and needed to activate it, and then never again.</p>

<p>This happened to thousands of people. It   s why Apple made cloud-based backups one of the fundamental pillars of iCloud. It still happens, today, to people who haven   t signed up for iCloud and enabled iCloud backups. It   s heartbreaking in most cases, and downright devastating in some. I   ve heard from Genius Bar staffers who eventually left the job because of the stress of dealing with customers suffering data loss. Once it is determined that the photos and videos are irretrievable from the device and have never been backed up, the job of the Genius staffer turns from technician to grief counselor. <em>Bereavement</em> is not too strong a word.</p>

<p>iCloud backups have not eliminated this problem, but they have made it far less common. This is, like almost everything in tech, a trade-off:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your data is far safer from irretrievable loss if it is synced/backed up, regularly, to a cloud-based service.</p></li>
<li><p>Your data is more at risk of being stolen if it is synced/backed up, regularly, to a cloud-based service.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the companies that provide such services minimize the risk of your account being hijacked while maximizing the simplicity and ease of setting it up and using it. But clearly these two goals are in conflict. There   s no way around the fact that the proper balance is somewhere in between maximal security and minimal complexity.</p>

<p>Further, I would wager heavily that there are thousands and thousands more people who have been traumatized by irretrievable data loss (who would have been saved if they   d had cloud-based backups) than those who have been victimized by having their cloud-based accounts hijacked (who would have been saved if they had only stored their data locally on their devices).</p>

<p>It is thus, in my opinion, terribly irresponsible to advise people to blindly not trust Apple (or Google, or Dropbox, or Microsoft, etc.) with  8220 any of your data 8221  without emphasizing, clearly and adamantly, that by only storing their data on-device, they greatly increase the risk of losing everything.</p>

<p>The problems here are multifaceted and complicated   8220 don   t trust anything in the cloud 8221  is simplistic and, in its own way, dangerous.</p>

<p><strong>Postscript:</strong> And what about email and messaging? If one doesn   t trust Apple or other cloud-based providers with backups, how can you trust them with email or messages, both of which often contain photos? Further, <a href="https://twitter.com/charlietuna/status/507275063272677376">as Charles Ying pointed out</a>, Apple is set to improve on this very thing in iOS 8 <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/apples-imessage-adds-self-destructing-audio-and-video-messages-location-sharing/">with self-destructing attachments in iMessage</a>.&nbsp <a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Security Trade-Offs’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/09/security_tradeoffs"> 9733 </a></p>

<h1><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/08/larger_iphone_display_conjecture" title="Permanent link to ‘Conjecture Regarding Larger iPhone Displays’">Conjecture Regarding Larger iPhone 160 Displays</a></h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Friday, 22 August 2014</h6>

<p>Throughout the entire rumor cycle for this year   s new iPhones, we   ve been inundated with reports of two new screen sizes, 4.7 and 5.5 inches. But while the physical sizes of these displays leaked early and often, the exact pixel dimensions <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/06/24/bloomberg-iphone-6">have not</a>.</p>

<p>At this point, there   s too much smoke around the  8220 <em>two new iPhones, one at 4.7 inches and the other 5.5 inches</em> 8221  narrative for there not to be a fire. I think that   s what Apple is planning to announce next month  8212  not because anyone  8220 familiar with the plans 8221  has told me so, but simply because so many parts have leaked corroborating these two sizes.</p>

<p>I   ve spent much of the last month trying to figure out the pixel counts for these displays, and it   s actually quite tricky. When Apple changed the iPhone display previously, they did so in obvious ways. With the iPhone 4   s retina display, Apple kept the physical size exactly the same (3.5 inches<sup id="fnr1-2014-08-22"><a href="#fn1-2014-08-22">1</a></sup>) and exactly doubled the pixels-per-inch resolution (from 163 to 326). When the iPhone 5 increased the size to 4 inches and the aspect ratio (switching from 3:2 to 16:9), they simply added pixels vertically. Same pixels-per-inch resolution, same width (640 pixels), new height (1136 pixels instead of 960).</p>

<p>There is no similar  8220 easy 8221  way to do either a 4.7 or 5.5 iPhone display.</p>

<p>But after giving it much thought, and a lot of tinkering in a spreadsheet, here is what I think Apple is going to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>4.7-inch display: 1334 8201  215  8201 750, 326 PPI @2x</li>
<li>5.5-inch display: 2208 8201  215  8201 1242, 461 PPI @3x</li>
</ul>

<p>@2x means the same  8220 double 8221  retina resolution that we   ve seen on all iOS devices with retina displays to date, where each virtual <em>point</em> in the user interface is represented by two physical pixels on the display in each dimension, horizontal and vertical. @3x means a new  8220 triple 8221  retina resolution, where each user interface point is represented by three display pixels. A single @2x point is a 2 8201  215  8201 2 square of 4 pixels  an @3x point is a 3 8201  215  8201 3 square of 9 pixels.</p>

<p>I could be wrong on either or both of these conjectured new iPhones. I derived these figures on my own, and I   ll explain my thought process below. No one who is truly  8220 familiar with the situation 8221  has told me a damn thing about either device. I have heard second- and third-hand stories, though, that lead me to think I   m right.</p>

<h2>How I Derived These Figures</h2>

<p>First, I   m assuming both the 4.7 and 5.5 inch rumors are true. Second, I   m assuming a 16:9 aspect ratio for both displays.<sup id="fnr2-2014-08-22"><a href="#fn2-2014-08-22">2</a></sup> Given these assumptions and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_Theorem">Pythagorean Theorem</a>, it   s easy to create a spreadsheet model that gives you the pixels-per-inch resolution for a given pixel count.</p>

<p>For example, consider the 4.7-inch display. That   s the diagonal measured in inches. Given the height and width in pixels, we can solve for the diagonal in pixels (<em>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></em>). Starting with values of 1334 and 750 for <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, we get roughly 1530.4 pixels diagonally solving for <em>c</em>. Divide 1530.4 by 4.7 inches, and you get 326 pixels/inch  8212  <em>exactly</em> the same pixel density as all previous iPhone retina displays (and the retina iPad Mini).</p>

<p>When I   ve written about this sort of diagonal pixel division in the past, I   ve gotten complaints that there   s no such thing as  8220 diagonal pixels 8221  or fractional pixels. But for our purposes, that doesn   t matter. Effectively we   re treating  8220 pixel 8221  as a unit of measure  8212  the length of an actual pixel on the display. If you don   t believe me, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem the other way, to <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/63681/calculate-width-and-height-of-a-rectangle-given-its-diagonal-and-ratio">compute the length of the sides in inches given the diagonal in inches and the aspect ratio</a>. A 16:9 display with a diagonal measuring 4.7 inches has a height of 4.1 inches and width of 2.3. 1334/4.1 and 750/2.3 both work out to roughly 326 pixels per inch. Trust the math.</p>

<p>Keeping the same 326 pixels-per-inch density would fit with the patterns Apple has established. They keep reusing the same pixel densities across iOS devices. In the past, I   ve speculated that this might be a matter of economy of scale  8212  that they just cut different size displays from the same (large) sheets of LCDs. I no longer think that   s the reason. For one thing, they stick to these same pixel densities even across devices that use entirely different displays. The iPhone 5, retina iPod Touch, and retina iPad Mini all use 326 PPI displays, but all three use different LCD display technology.</p>

<p>I think the explanation has more to do with the physical size of user interface elements and touch accessibility. It   s about <em>points</em>. User interfaces in iOS aren   t specified in display pixels, they   re specified in virtual <em>points</em>. On non-retina devices, points and pixels were one and the same. But as stated earlier, on @2x retina devices, each (virtual) point represents two (physical) pixels on the display in each dimension.</p>

<p>Apple has always recommended tappable targets of at least 44 points. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/LayoutandAppearance.html">From the iOS HIG</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make it easy for people to interact with content and controls by
giving each interactive element ample spacing. Give tappable
controls a hit target of about 44 8201  215  8201 44 points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This recommendation is based not on aesthetics  8212  how the controls look  8212  but on the size of human fingertips. That   s the real constraint. 44 points isn   t a magic number  it   s a by-product of the size of the pixels on the original 2007 iPhone display (pre-retina, one point equaled one pixel). On every iPhone to date, from the original through the 5S and 5C, there has been a single consistent <em>point</em> resolution: 163 points per inch. That means a 44 8201  215  8201 44 point UI element has remained exactly the same physical size (as measured in inches or millimeters).</p>

<p>The original iPad introduced a second point resolution: 132 points per inch. This has remained consistent on the large (9.7 inch) iPads. The iPad Mini (both original and retina) uses the iPhone   s 163 points-per-inch resolution. Apple   s recommended target sizes did not change for the 9.7-inch iPad: they simply made the recommended tap targets physically larger. 44 points on an iPhone or iPad Mini is roughly 0.27 inches (6.9 mm). 44 points on a 9.7-inch iPad is 0.33 inches (8.4 mm). Everything is bigger by a factor of about 1.24.</p>

<p>Making UI elements (and text) bigger on the iPad works, both in terms of touch and visual accessibility. Making UI elements smaller, however, would not work, either physically (touch sizes) or visually (legibility). Any changes that Apple makes to iOS displays, in terms of physical dimensions or pixel resolution, necessitate extra work for app developers and designers to fully support. They   ve gone from @1x to @2x, and eventually (I think next month) they will go to @3x. They   ve introduced three different aspect ratios: 3:2 (now deprecated), 16:9 (all recent iPhones), and 4:3 (all iPads). They   ve used two different sizes of the same aspect ratio (iPad and iPad Mini).</p>

<p>But what they have never done, and I believe never will do, is redefine the virtual <em>point</em> to something other than 1/44th the recommended minimum tap target size for every device.</p>

<p>Apple has already started encouraging iOS developers to begin using adaptive layout techniques. See session 216 from WWDC 2014: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/#216">Building Adaptive Apps with UIKit</a>. What   s telling when you watch that session and read the documentation is that developers should clearly anticipate new aspect ratios (whether for new displays, or for a still-hypothetical but <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/06/11/heres-the-ipad-split-screen-app-mode-apple-is-working-on-in-ios-8-video/">rumored split-screen multitasking feature on future iPads</a>) and physical sizes, but nowhere is there any suggestion that the role of the <em>point</em> as the UI unit of measure is changing.</p>

<p>This is important when speculating about new iOS device displays. Take the physical pixels-per-inch of the display, divide by the retina factor (@1x, @2x, @3x, etc.), and you get the points-per-inch for that proposed display. If that result is higher than 163 points-per-inch, then a 44-point UI element would be undesirably small as a touch target for human fingertips. What we want are display resolutions that provide more total points but the same or <em>fewer</em> points-per-inch.</p>

<p>Now, in theory, Apple could go ahead and do this anyway, and on such a device developers would have to use an entirely different recommended size, in points, for UI elements. But effectively that would require double the design work. The <em>adaptive</em> techniques and APIs that Apple is recommending (again, see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/#216">WWDC 2014 Session 216</a>) are intended to enable apps to be designed just once and flexibly <em>adapt</em> to different displays.</p>

<p>It   s also important to consider the two possible (and not necessarily conflicting) reasons why larger displays are desirable:</p>

<ol>
<li>To show more content on the display at once.</li>
<li>To make the content on the display physically larger.</li>
</ol>

<p>#1 is about showing more content on screen (e.g. more text per page in an e-book). #2 is about making the content bigger (e.g. larger text in an e-book). #1 is about increasing the number of <em>points</em>, not (only) the number of pixels. #2 requires larger points (fewer points per inch).</p>

<h2>Using the Above Assumptions and Concepts to Consider Hypothetical iPhone Display Resolutions, Starting With 1136 8201  215  8201 640</h2>

<p>As a baseline, let   s consider the existing iPhone 5 / 5C / 5S display:</p>

<table style="width:500px  margin-left:0 ">

</table>

<p>The easiest thing Apple could do to create 4.7 and 5.5 inch displays would be to use the current 1136 8201  215  8201 640 pixel resolution, but this leads to several undesirable results, even though developers would have to do nothing new to support it. Such a 4.7-inch display would have a resolution of only 277 pixels per inch, and a 5.5-inch display would come in at only 237 pixels per inch. Neither display would show any additional content compared to the iPhone 5, and though everything would be physically bigger, the lower pixel-per-inch resolution would make everything look jaggier, especially on the 5.5-inch model. That   s not going to happen. New iPhone displays need to look as good as or better than the existing ones.</p>

<h2>1704 8201  215  8201 960: Only Works Well for 4.0-inch Displays</h2>

<p>Now, let   s consider an oft-cited prospective new iPhone resolution, 1704 8201  215  8201 960, <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/05/14/likely-iphone-6-with-sharper-larger-1704-x-960-resolution-screen-in-testing/">about which 9to5Mac   s Mark Gurman reported in May</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fast forward to 2014, and Apple is preparing to make another
significant screen adjustment to the iPhone. Instead of
retaining the current resolution, sources familiar with the
testing of at least one next-generation iPhone model say that
Apple plans to scale the next iPhone display with a
pixel-tripling (3X) mode. [ 8230 ]</p>

<p>568 tripled is 1704 and 320 tripled is 960, and sources indicate
that Apple is testing a 1704 8201  215  8201 960 resolution display for the
iPhone 6. Tripling the iPhone 5’s base resolution would mean that
the iPhone 6’s screen will retain the same 16:9 aspect ratio as
the iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, and iPhone 5c.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply tripling the base point size would make things relatively easy for developers  8212  it   d be akin to the 2010 introduction of the first retina device, the iPhone 4. Developers would just need to add @3x graphic assets.<sup id="fnr3-2014-08-22"><a href="#fn3-2014-08-22">3</a></sup> The layout of the app, as specified in points, would remain unchanged.</p>

<p>I think Gurman was right that Apple was testing an @3x mode. I   m almost certain he was wrong that they ever tested 1704 8201  215  8201 960, unless they considered a new iPhone with a 4.0-inch display. That   s the only size at which 1704 8201  215  8201 960 makes any sense. Why? Because as measured in <em>points</em>, an @3x 1704 8201  215  8201 960 display would show no additional content compared to the iPhone 5. It   d still be 568 8201  215  8201 320 points. (One could comfortably reduce their Dynamic Type system-wide font size preference on such a display, but it wouldn   t increase the amount of content displayed by default. Dynamic Type alone is not a good enough solution to showing more content  8212  the only good solution is increasing the number of <em>points</em>, not just the number of pixels.)</p>

<p>A 4.7-inch 1704 8201  215  8201 960 display would require a 416 pixels-per-inch display, and would have a scaling factor of 1.18 compared to all previous iPhones. It would display the same content, but everything would be 1.18 times larger. A 5.5-inch 1704 8201  215  8201 960 display would require a 356 pixels-per-inch display, and would display content at a comically large 1.38 scaling factor. (For comparison   s sake, the iPad Air has a scaling factor of 1.24 compared to the iPad Mini.)</p>

<p>The one thing that   s magic about 1704 8201  215  8201 960 is that it   s the one resolution that would keep the iPhone akin to the iPad  8212  multiple physical sizes and retina factors, but with one universal dimension in terms of <em>points</em>. You know how iPad apps have the exact same 1024 8201  215  8201 768 layout on all iPads, just with different physical and retina scales? That   s what 1704 8201  215  8201 960 (with @3x retina scale) would do for the iPhone. I think the iPhone is fundamentally different from the iPad in this regard, however.</p>

<p>(As I said above, 1704 8201  215  8201 960 would work perfectly for a new 4.0-inch iPhone with @3x retina scaling. Layout and UI element sizes would remain unchanged from the iPhone 5 series, but everything would look 1.5 times sharper with a 489 pixels-per-inch display. By all accounts, however, there is no such device in the works. Apple seems to be leaving the 4.0-inch size behind.)</p>

<p>At 4.7 inches, 1334 8201  215  8201 750 works perfectly as a new iPhone display, addressing problem #1, showing more content. With point dimensions of 667 8201  215  8201 375, this display would show 1.38 times more points than the iPhone 5. At 326 pixels-per-inch, everything on screen would remain exactly the same physical size. There would just be 38 percent more room for content.</p>

<p>This resolution is feasible for a 5.5-inch display, but doesn   t work well enough in my opinion, for the reasons italicized in the above table. 278 pixels-per-inch is unacceptably low  8212  again, new iPhone displays need to look as good as or better than the previous models, and 278 pixels-per-inch is too low. Apple does this with the iPad Air and Mini (two sizes, same pixel count), but the iPad Air gets away with its sub-300 pixels-per-inch display because you tend to hold it further away from your eyes than you do a phone.</p>

<p>If Apple were to use this display resolution for both the 4.7- and 5.5-inch phones, the relationship between the two devices would only be a matter of scale. Everything on the 5.5-inch iPhone would appear 1.17 times larger than on the 4.7-inch one, but they would each show the same amount of content. I don   t think that   s a good enough reason to produce two new larger iPhone display sizes.</p>

That, indeed, was interesting  8212  but not so much at @2x, as Gurman posited.</p>

<p>This resolution is a non-starter for a 4.7-inch phone on the basis of <em>scaling</em>. With 180 points per inch, UI elements and text would be rendered almost 10 percent <em>smaller</em> than on an iPhone 5. With a scaling factor of 0.91, I don   t think it would appear comically small, but no one expects or wants things to appear smaller on a 4.7-inch phone than they do on a 4.0-inch phone. Not going to happen.</p>

<p>At 5.5 inches, however, this resolution works. The only hiccup is that the display would be  8220 only 8221  307 pixels-per-inch. That meets <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4">Apple   s original 2010 definition of  8220 retina display 8221  as 300+ PPI</a>, but just barely. Sticking with @2x retina scale would be less work for UI designers, and such a display would cost less and be less graphically taxing than what I   m about to propose, but a new iPhone with a lower resolution (in terms of pixels-per-inch) display is a bitter pill to ask people to swallow. Again, I think the display on a new top-tier iPhone must be as good or better than the previous model in every way. 307 pixels-per-inch doesn   t quite cut it, I think. (If I   m wrong about anything in this piece, however, this might be it  8212  that 307 pixels-per-inch number is the only thing I see <em>wrong</em> about a 5.5-inch 1472 8201  215  8201 828 display.)</p>

<h2>2208 8201  215  8201 1242: The 5.5-inch    Holy Shit    Sweet Spot</h2>

<p>Take the same 736 8201  215  8201 414 <em>point</em> display size, and apply a retina scaling factor of @3x instead of @2x, and you get a very intriguing 5.5-inch iPhone:</p>

<p>Nothing changes compared to 1472 8201  215  8201 828 but one thing: pixels-per-inch resolution. The 4.7-inch size is still out because the scaling factor would render everything almost 10 percent smaller.</p>

<p>Everything works at these dimensions for a 5.5-inch display. With an increase in area of 68 percent and a scaling factor of 1.06, this display would address both reasons why someone might want a very large iPhone: it would show a <em>lot</em> more content, and it would render everything on screen, point-for-point, a little bit bigger. And at 461 pixels-per-inch, everything would be amazingly sharp. At that point it would be difficult for most of us to perceive individual pixels from any viewing distance, not just from typical practical viewing distance. This would be so sweet, I   d wager Apple comes up with a new marketing name for it: <em>super-retina</em> or something.<sup id="fnr4-2014-08-22"><a href="#fn4-2014-08-22">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The only issue is whether it   s technically feasible for Apple: (a) to obtain sufficient supply of 461 PPI displays at a reasonable cost, and (b) to produce a GPU capable of pushing that many pixels. (b) Might not be a problem at all, considering that last year   s A7 SoC is already capable of driving the 2048 8201  215  8201 1536 retina iPad displays without breaking a sweat. As for (a), rumors abound that @3x is a real thing, and if that   s true, I think it   s for the 5.5-inch phone. In terms of the total number of pixels, the technical jump from the iPhone 5 series to this display would be quite comparable to that from the 3GS to the iPhone 4. With the 3GS to the 4, the number of pixels exactly quadrupled. Going from the 1136 8201  215  8201 640 iPhone 5 display to a new 2208 8201  215  8201 1242 display would increase the total number of pixels by a factor of about 3.8. After four years of @2x retina scale, I think it   s plausible that Apple could pull this off  8212  especially since they pulled off the @1x to @2x jump after only three years.</p>

<p>The technical and manufacturing difficulties involved in such a leap could well explain the <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/07/25/mass-production-iphone-6/">pervasive rumors</a> that the new 5.5-inch trails the 4.7-inch model in terms of production. It also fits with pervasive rumors that it will cost at least <a href="http://bgr.com/2014/06/13/iphone-6-4-7-inches-vs-5-5-inches/">$100 more</a>.</p>

<h2>Other Resolutions</h2>

<p>1564 8201  215  8201 880 is feasible for a 5.5-inch phone. That   s what you get if you maintain the 326 pixels-per-inch density and @2x scale. This would increase <em>area</em>  8212  the number of <em>points</em> displayed on screen  8212  by a whopping 89 percent. But it wouldn   t increase the size of what you see <em>at all</em>. I think the sweet spot for a 5.5-inch phone would allow you to see more content <em>and</em> make what you see at least a little bit bigger. So that   s why I   d bet against 1564 8201  215  8201 880. (1564 8201  215  8201 880 would be implausible for the 4.7-inch phone: it would render UI elements and text 15 percent smaller than all previous iPhones.)</p>

<p>1920 8201  215  8201 1080 is a standard resolution for  8220 high definition 8221 , but the numbers only work for 4.7 inches at @3x retina scale:</p>

<p>None of those numbers jumps out at me as terrible (although the 1.22 scaling factor at 5.5 inches comes close), but none of them are particularly compelling either. At 4.7 inches, 1920 8201  215  8201 1080 would give you 27 percent more content (in points), and would increase the scale of points by 4 percent. Both of those are plausible, and a reasonable balance between showing more content and bigger content. But it seems like a worse tradeoff balance for 4.7 inches than my perceived sweet spot of 1334 8201  215  8201 750. I   ve repeated those numbers in the chart above for comparison. I think for the 4.7-inch phone, you want to focus on more content, not bigger content, and 1334 8201  215  8201 750 is a better  8212  and cheaper, and more power efficient  8212  option for that.</p>

<p>At 1920 8201  215  8201 1080, a 5.5-inch iPhone would skew too heavily toward showing bigger content than more content. People who really want bigger text would be served just as well, I think, with a 2208 8201  215  8201 1242 @3x display and changing the Dynamic Type font size. At 1920 8201  215  8201 1080, <em>everyone</em> would get very large type by default. Even worse, a 1920 8201  215  8201 1080 5.5-inch phone at @3x would have fewer <em>points</em> than a 1334 8201  215  8201 750 4.7-inch iPhone at @2x (640 8201  215  8201 360 vs. 667 8201  215  8201 375, respectively). I don   t think it   s feasible for the physically larger phone to show less on-screen content. This is why it   s essential to consider <em>points</em>, not just pixels.</p>

<p>Lastly, I considered 2272 8201  215  8201 1280 at @4x retina scale. Jumping from @2x to @4x would make things much easier for iOS UI designers (see <a href="#fn3-2014-08-22">footnote 3</a> below), but Apple   s top priority isn   t making life easier for UI designers. 2272 8201  215  8201 1280 is exactly double the current 1136 8201  215  8201 640 iPhone 5 display. The problem with that is that it doesn   t change the screen size in terms of <em>points</em> at all. You   d see exactly the same amount of content, only bigger (on the 4.7-inch phone) or much bigger (on the 5.5). Everything would look incredibly sharp as well, but I think showing <em>more</em> content is an essential aspect of the demand for large-screen phones.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The three main factors to consider for a new iPhone display size:</p>

<ol>
<li>Content area: showing more <em>points</em> on screen.</li>
<li>Scaling factor: the number of <em>points</em> per inch.</li>
<li>Sharpness/quality: the number of <em>pixels</em> per inch.</li>
</ol>

<p>A 4.7-inch iPhone at 1334 8201  215  8201 750 pixels would change only one of those: content area. The points-per-inch and pixels-per-inch would remain unchanged from the iPhone 5 series, but the display would expand from 568 8201  215  8201 320 points to 667 8201  215  8201 375, an increase of 38 percent. This is such an Apple-like thing to do  8212  keeping the exact same 326 pixels-per-inch density and simply putting more pixels in both dimensions to make a larger display  8212  that I   m surprised I can only find one mention of it: <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/04/09/kgi-iphone6-predictions/">an April report from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo</a>. (In that same note, Chi-Kuo pegged the 5.5-inch iPhone at 1920 8201  215  8201 1080, which, for the reasons outlined above, I very much doubt.)</p>

<p>A 5.5-inch iPhone at 2208 8201  215  8201 1242 pixels (and @3x retina scaling) would improve all three factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>Content area: with 736 8201  215  8201 414 <em>points</em>, viewable content area would increase by 68 percent over the iPhone 5 (and 21 percent over my conjectured 1334 8201  215  8201 750 4.7-inch phone).</li>
<li>At 154 <em>points</em> per inch, points would be 6 percent bigger than on all other iPhones to date. Just a little bigger, not a lot bigger, which is probably just what the doctor ordered.</li>
<li>At 461 pixels per inch, everything would be rendered incredibly sharply.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, those are my guesses.<sup id="fnr5-2014-08-22"><a href="#fn5-2014-08-22">5</a></sup>&nbsp <a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Conjecture Regarding Larger iPhone Displays’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/08/larger_iphone_display_conjecture"> 9733 </a></p>

<p>Moving to @3x from @2x is actually quite a bit trickier than moving from @1x to @2x was, because the math is no longer tidy. When you double, everything remains an even number. @3x leads to odd numbers. For example, what do you do with a 3-pixel wide stroke from your @2x interface? You can   t render it at 4.5 pixels, so you have choose between rendering it at 4 or 5 pixels, making it slightly thinner or thicker. Or you could anti-alias it to approximate a 4.5-pixel stroke width, in which case you sacrifice sharpness and precision. We   re talking about hundredths of an inch, but trust me, iOS designers care about this. @3x is going to be a bit of a pain in the ass for pixel-obsessive designers.&nbsp <a href="#fnr3-2014-08-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text."> 8617 </a></p>
