<p>In his first prime time address to the nation in a year, Obama will try to make the case to the American people that ISIS is a threat to the broader Middle East and to the U.S., outlining expanded diplomatic and military campaigns to tackle ISIS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So tonight, with a new Iraqi government in place, and following consultations with allies abroad and Congress at home, I can announce that America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat,&#8221; Obama will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House. &#8220;Our objective is clear: We will degrade, and ultimately destroy, [ISIS] through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the past month, the U.S. has conducted more than 150 airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq with the limited authority to protect American facilities and provide humanitarian relief. Obama will signal the expansion of those efforts to a campaign &#8220;to take out [ISIS] wherever they exist using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years,&#8221; Obama will say.</p>
<p>No American troops will be involved in direct combat against ISIS on the ground, Obama will reaffirm, but more than 1,000 U.S. forces are in Iraq protecting American facilities and advising and training Iraqi and Kurdish forces.</p>
<p>Secretary of State John Kerry is traveling the region this week to build the international coalition Obama is seeking to take on ISIS. At the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Wales last week, Obama secured the support of many U.S. allies to assist in the effort against the group.</p>
<p>American officials have repeatedly said they are not aware of any active plots by ISIS against the U.S. homeland, but they are concerned by the thousands of foreign fighters, including more than 100 Americans, who are believed to be battling alongside ISIS and could return to the United States to carry out attacks in the future.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3319522"></div></aside>

<p>Behind-the-scenes negotiations on how Scotland would extract itself from the U.K. would begin almost immediately. Alex Salmond, Scotland&rsquo;s First Minister spearheading the campaign, has said his deputy Nicola Sturgeon would lead the negotiation talks on behalf of the Scottish nationalists. Westminster has not yet announced who would lead its team.</p>
<p><b>Would the United Kingdom have to change its name?</b></p>
<p>Whereas the name &#8220;Great Britain&#8221; refers to a geographical union, the &#8220;United Kingdom&#8221; refers to a political one, taking its name from the 1707 Act of Union. If Scotland becomes independent, it&#8217;s possible that both names may change, though in reality the country could (and probably would) keep the names. The handle &#8220;the rest of the U.K.&#8221;, typically abbreviated to rU.K., has been used frequently, though both &#8220;continuing U.K.&#8221;and &#8220;Future U.K.&#8221; have been floated as options.</p>
<p><strong>Would Scotland be in the European Union?</strong></p>
<p>Eventually, yes. According to the pro-independence campaign, <a href="http://www.yesscotland.net/answers/will-scotland-be-european-union%20" target="_blank">&#8220;Scotland&#8217;s EU membership will be secure&#8221;</a> by the time of independence. But it may not be as quick or straightforward as the &#8220;Yes&#8221; campaign has said. EU treaties do not specify a protocol for a member state breaking apart, and Brussels has said that Scotland will probably have to apply to join. This process will be slowed by debate over whether Scotland could opt out of the EU&rsquo;s single currency zone (since all EU member states have to join the euro once the necessary conditions are fulfilled) and by concerns from countries like Spain and Belgium who face pressure from their own secessionist movements. Since EU policies and legal regulations already apply in Scotland, the majority of negotiations shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult. However, while Salmond claims the transition to EU member state can be done within 18 months, waiting for approval from all 28 countries is likely to take considerably longer.</p>
<p><strong>What would independence mean for Scotland&rsquo;s defense force and for NATO?</strong></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign supports continued membership of NATO, but Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/defence/article4180414.ece" target="_blank">has said</a> an independent Scotland would not be guaranteed an automatic place in the defense organization. Scotland would have to reapply to NATO as a new state and all 28 member states would need to unanimously agree on enlargement. The process could take years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Scottish nationalists are opposed to having the U.K&#8217;s nuclear arsenal at its Faslane naval base on the west coast of Scotland and would like to see it removed as soon as possible. If Scotland votes yes, the SNP intends to remove both the Trident nuclear deterrent and nuclear warheads in nearby Loch Long by 2020. Since there are no clear alternative naval bases in the U.K. for the Trident submarines, their transfer to another part of Britain would be inevitably difficult, lengthy and expensive. In fact, the Henry Jackson Society think tank <a href="http://henryjacksonsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/HJS-In-Scotlands-Defence-Report-LOW-RES.pdf%20" target="_blank">argues that </a>Scottish independence could unilaterally disarm the rest of the U.K., essentially requiring an abandonment of its nuclear program.</p>
<div>Given that NATO is fundamentally a nuclear alliance, U.K. ministers have warned that Scotland&rsquo;s application could be vetoed if the SNP pursues its pledge to ban nuclear weapons on Scottish. Des Browne, former Secretary of State for Defense and Scotland, says &ldquo;a vote to leave the UK is a vote to leave Nato, the most successful defense and security alliance in the world.&rdquo;</div>
<p><strong>Would David Cameron have to resign?</strong></p>
<p>The Prime Minister has said he &#8220;emphatically&#8221; would not resign if Scotland decides to leave the U.K. Nonetheless, he would certainly be under great pressure to do so from both his own party (who are technically still the &lsquo;Conservative and Unionist party&rsquo;) and the opposition. Senior party members have <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11082875/David-Cameron-is-in-serious-trouble-with-his-party-over-the-referendum-warn-Tory-MPs.html" target="_blank">suggested</a> Cameron may face a parliamentary vote of no confidence in the wake of the referendum<strong>,</strong> possibly just for allowing the referendum to take place.</p>
<p><strong>Would there still be a U.K. General Election in May 2015? Would Scottish voters be able to take part?</strong></p>
<p>There has been talk of delaying the General Election to prohibit Scottish voters from choosing the government of a union it intends to leave. Postponing remains unlikely because, bar one exception during World War II, parliamentary terms in the U.K. are always fixed at a maximum of five years. Scottish voters would still be able to participate but their representatives would serve only a 10-month term in office since Scottish MPs would have to leave Westminster on Independence Day in March 2016.</p>
<p><strong>How would that change the makeup of the U.K. parliament?</strong></p>
<p>The impact on future electoral outcomes without Scotland has been <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/scotland-the-referendum-and-independence/impact-on-the-uk-parliament/%20" target="_blank">heavily discussed</a>, with suggestions of a hung parliament if Scottish MPs are excluded. But <a href="http://wingsoverscotland.com/why-labour-doesnt-need-scotland/%20" target="_blank">an analysis</a> of General Election results since the end of World War II shows that Scottish MPs have had a practical influence over the composition of the U.K. government on just three occasions. Scottish MPs turned a Conservative government into a Labour one with a wafer-thin majority of 4 in 1964 and a majority of 3 in 1974. In 2010, Scotland prevented the Conservatives from winning by an outright majority, compelling them to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. Of the current existing 59 Scottish seats, the Conservatives have only 1, the Liberal Democrats have 11 and Labour have 41. While Scotland could be critical to Labour&rsquo;s ability to win an overall majority in 2015, past results suggest that the election in 2015 really depends on support in the rest of the U.K. for Ed Miliband&rsquo;s Labour campaign.</p>
<p><strong>What currency would an independent Scotland use?</strong></p>
<p>Although Salmond has insisted that Scotland would keep the pound sterling, the three main Westminster parties (Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrats) have ruled out a currency union. Other possibilities for Scotland include sterlingization (the use of the pound but outside a formal union, which could diminish financial security), joining the euro or creating a new currency.</p>
<p><strong>What would happen to the U.K. national debt? How much would be transferred to Scotland?</strong></p>
<p>This is yet to be decided. It is likely to be calculated on a per capita basis, according to population size.</p>
<p><strong>What would happen to benefits and taxes?</strong></p>
<p>Both benefits and taxes would become the responsibility of the new Scottish government. The Scottish Parliament would ensure that the personal tax allowance and tax credits increase in line with inflation. Tax would stay the same until a new government, elected in 2016, chooses how to change it. However, wide variations in forecasts for the revenue of an independent Scotland make it difficult to calculate potential changes for the individual taxpayer. The pro-union side has challenged the SNP&rsquo;s plan for the benefits system, arguing that uncertainty is the inevitable outcome and that Scotland&#8217;s benefits would be more secure if it remained part of the U.K.</p>
<p><strong>What would happen to Scotland&rsquo;s businesses?</strong></p>
<p>The oil revenues in the North Sea have always been considered essential to the economic viability of Scotland as an independent nation state. The figures propounded by the Yes campaign about the quantity of oil and gas reserves (Salmond estimates &pound;1.5 trillion pounds ($2.5tn) remain) have proved one of the most contentious points of the independence debates. While Salmond has asserted oil would support the country &ldquo;way beyond 2050&rdquo;, Sir Ian Wood, a leading Scottish oil executive and industry expert, asserts that Salmond is overestimating the remaining reserves by 45 &ndash; 60%. BP, the major oil company employing over 4,000 people in the North Sea region, released a statement Wednesday in support of Wood&rsquo;s claims and urging Scotland to vote against independence.</p>
<p>Standard Life, the pensions and insurance giant based in the Scottish capital Edinburgh, has warned that it would move large parts of its business out of Scotland in order to protect its customers in the event of secession. As a contingency plan, Standard Life has started registering new English subsidiaries to which it could transfer parts of its business. Neither the Royal Bank of Scotland nor Lloyds Banking Group have announced yet that they would move their main bases to London, but companies would have 18 months until official independence to make any decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Would Scottish citizens need new passports?</strong></p>
<p>This largely depends on whether Scotland can join the EU. Scottish citizens would be entitled to a Scottish passport, but a U.K. passport would still be valid until it expires. British citizens &#8220;habitually resident&#8221; in Scotland would be automatically considered Scottish citizens and qualify to apply for Scottish passports.</p>
<p><strong>Would passports be needed to cross the England-Scotland border?</strong></p>
<p>An independent Scotland would be responsible for its own borders, but the Scottish government has signaled that it would not want to sign up to the Schengen free-travel area which covers much of western Europe. As far as the rest of the U.K. is concerned, Home Secretary Theresa May has warned that independence would lead to &ldquo;profound changes for migration policy.&rdquo; Scotland&rsquo;s plan to pursue &ldquo;healthy population growth&rdquo; has been interpreted as implying a looser immigration policy. The Conservatives, who prefer a harder line on immigration, have expressed concerns at the possibility of Scotland becoming &ldquo;a convenient landing point for migration into the United Kingdom.&rdquo; From Westminster&rsquo;s point of view, border controls and passport checks are a real possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Would Scotland keep the Queen?</strong></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign has said that Her Majesty would remain as monarch, since the referendum concerns the 1707 Union of the Nations, as opposed to the 1603 Union of the Crowns. Buckingham Palace <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29136149" target="_blank">insists that</a> the Queen is politically neutral and that she will not be intervening in the independence debate. In the short term, Scotland&rsquo;s draft constitution would keep the Queen as Queen of Scotland, but there could well be another referendum on the subject.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3318806"></div></aside>

<div>Meanwhile, the FCC reported that its rule on net neutrality, which is open for public comments until Sept. 15, has officially</div>
<div>generated more public comments&#8211;1.4 million and counting&#8211;than any other rule making in its history.</div>
<p>The coalition of Internet activists that organized today&#8217;s campaign, <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/" target="_blank">Battle for the Net</a>, includes 27 progressive advocacy organizations, including Common Cause and the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as dozens of tech companies, including Twitter, Tumblr, Netflix, Kickstarter and Etsy. Vimeo, which is also a member, produced its own <a href="//vimeo.com/105602328" target="_blank">net neutrality video</a> Wednesday.</p>
<p>Those companies, along with thousands of smaller websites, took part in a &ldquo;day of action&rdquo; Wednesday in which they <a href="https://imgur.com/a/KHnr7" target="_blank">displayed on their home pages </a>an icon symbolizing a slow-loading website. When visitors click on that icon, they are invited to sign the Battle for the Net&rsquo;s letter to the FCC and to contact their member of Congress.</p>
<p>The campaign used a nifty new technology that allowed visitors to simply type-in their phone number and zip code, and the app would figure out who their member of Congress was. Almost immediately, a visitor&#8217;s phone would start ringing and when they answered&#8211;presto!&#8211;they were already connected to their member of Congress&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>The pro-net neutrality campaign has drawn an enormous amount of attention from the large cable and telecom companies in recent weeks, no more so than Comcast, the biggest ISP in the country.</p>
<p>Comcast, which is hoping that the FCC and the Justice Department will approve it&#8217;s $45.2 billion merger with Time Warner Cable in the next few months, has gone out of its way to underscore its support for net neutrality.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want you to know that Comcast has no desire to break the Internet &ndash; or to do anything else to disturb its fundamental openness,&#8221; wrote David Cohen, a Comcast senior vice president in a <a href="http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/comcast-supports-the-open-internet" target="_blank">press release</a> Wednesday evening. &#8220;We support maintaining an open Internet, and a role for the FCC ensuring that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Open Internet advocates dismissed Cohen&#8217;s promises as spin, arguing that Comcast and the FCC are simply using a different definition of &#8220;net neutrality&#8221; so that they can claim to support it.</p>
<p>Battle for the Net, which was joined by the Internet Association&#8211;an umbrella group that includes Google, Amazon and Facebook&#8211;says that net neutrality is fundamentally incompatible with so-called &#8220;paid prioritization&#8221; deals, which allow wealthy companies to pay ISPs to deliver their content more quickly on &#8220;Internet fast lanes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FCC&#8217;s proposed rules on net neutrality, which Comcast supports, allow for &#8220;paid prioritization&#8221; deals.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3319344"></div></aside>

<p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke in Congress Wednesday in support of funding the rebels, dismissing the potential cost. &#8220;I believe we need to train and equip Syrian rebels,&#8221; Reid said. &#8220;Going at it alone will not suffice.&#8221;</p>
<p>House Republicans are now debating whether to add the White House request to the pending government spending bill.</p>
<p>Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin (D&mdash;Mich.) and Sen. Bob Corker (R&mdash;Tenn.), the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters Wednesday that they support arming and training the Syrian rebels.</p>
<p>Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) noted that an overwhelming majority of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to arm moderate elements of the Syrian opposition in May 2013. &ldquo;I think the task has gotten harder in terms of determining how to do that in a way that the arms end up in the right hands,&rdquo; said Kaine. &ldquo;But I still think that that can be an appropriate way to deal with [ISIS] threats on the Syria side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not all senators support the measure, however. A spokesperson for Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said he &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t believe that we should fund rebels who could potentially be our enemies.&#8221;</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3319256"></div></aside>

    <h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">But Tom Wheeler says Washington football team's owner must decide to change name himself</h2>
    <aside class="right-rail-module rr-taboola-video" data-name="rr-taboola-video"><div id="taboola-right-rail-organic-video-3319206" class="taboola" data-mode="verticalx3" data-placement="right-rail-organic" data-type="video"></div></aside><p>Federal Communications Commission Chair Tom Wheeler <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/fccs-wheeler-redskins-name-offensive-should-go/133844" target="_blank">condemned</a> the Washington Redskins&rsquo; team name in a recent interview, but says he won&rsquo;t use his power to push the team&rsquo;s owner to change it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use the term personally and I think it is offensive and derogatory,&rdquo; Wheeler said in an interview with <em><a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/fccs-wheeler-redskins-name-offensive-should-go/133844" target="_blank">Broadcasting and Cable News</a></em>. &ldquo;I am a Civil War buff and there were a lot of terms that were appropriate at that time that aren&rsquo;t appropriate anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Wheeler went on to say that it is up to team owner Dan Snyder to ultimately change the name himself. &#8220;I think it would be great if the Washington football team would recognize those kinds of changes itself,&#8221; Wheeler said. &ldquo;I hope that this is something that if enough people express themselves, Dan Snyder can see which way things are going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeler isn&rsquo;t the first FCC official to speak out against the Washington football team&rsquo;s name. Former Chair <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/292077-former-officials-want-fcc-to-force-redskins-name-change" target="_blank">Reed Hundt</a> has said the name could potentially violate FCC decency standards. In a 2013 <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/292077-former-officials-want-fcc-to-force-redskins-name-change" target="_blank">letter</a>, several former FCC officials urged Snyder to abandon the name.</p>
<p>Snyder has said several times he has no plans to change the team&rsquo;s name or mascot. The team&#8217;s trademark was canceled because &ldquo;redskins&rdquo; is a dictionary defined racial slur, but the team has since appealed that decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given the important role the NFL and other major professional sports leagues can play in shaping public perceptions concerning domestic violence,&rdquo; the 12 Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee <a href="http://democrats.judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/Goodell140910.pdf" target="_blank">wrote.</a> &ldquo;It would appear to be in the public interest to have the highest level of transparency associated with reviews of potential misconduct.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-we-did-not-see-the-2nd-ray-rice-tape-earlier/" target="_blank">interview with CBS that aired Tuesday</a>, Goodell insisted the NFL had requested to see the video of the former Baltimore Ravens running back knocking his then-fianc&eacute;e unconscious in a casino elevator, but those requests weren&rsquo;t granted. On Monday, TMZ released the video and Rice was subsequently released from the Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL.</p>
<p>Lawmakers said the public is ill-informed about the specifics of the request including &ldquo;how relevant law enforcement responded.&rdquo; The members, including House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member John Conyers (D-Mich), also want to know whether or not Rice&rsquo;s attorney, any other NFL employees or consultants, or the casino staff had requested the video.</p>
<p>The letter comes as Congress commemorates the 20th anniversary of the passage of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, which provides assistance and protection to victims of domestic and relationship violence. The Democrats praised the NFL for recent changes to its policy for disciplining players who commit acts of domestic violence, but said professional leagues should &ldquo;be at the forefront of handling&rdquo; incidents of abuse.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3319132"></div></aside>

<p>&ldquo;He submitted his re-enlistment contract in August and crossed out&rdquo; <em>so help me God</em>, says Monica Miller, a lawyer with the American Humanist Society who is representing the unidentified airman. &ldquo;He was told he had to swear to those words, or else he would have to leave the Air Force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="inline-portrait_small_2x"><img src="http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-10-at-2-30-50-pm.png?w=560&#038;h=122" alt="" height="122"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><span class="caption">Final four words in the Air Force&rsquo;s re-enlistment contract.</span> <span class="credit">Air Force</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>&ldquo;We have been in compliance with Title 10 of the U.S. Code,&rdquo; which spells out the re-enlistment oath, says Captain Brooke Brzozowske, an Air Force spokeswoman. But the Air Force has kicked the matter up to the office of the Pentagon&rsquo;s top lawyer for a ruling. &ldquo;The airman&rsquo;s term of service expires in November 2014,&rdquo; Brzozowske adds. &ldquo;He has until this time to complete the Department of Defense Form 4 in compliance with the Title 10 U.S.C. <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title10/html/USCODE-2011-title10-subtitleA-partII-chap31-sec502.htm" target="_blank">Section 502</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a><img class="aligncenter size-portrait_small_2x wp-image-3319008" src="http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/oath-form-4.png?w=560&#038;h=212" alt="oath-form 4" width="560" height="212"></a></p>
<p>The airman is based at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada, and has chosen to remain anonymous. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid of retaliation and hostility from the public,&rdquo; Miller says. She says she will file suit in the case in federal court later this month if the Air Force continues to insist on her client swearing the oath.</p>
<p>The latest skirmish is part of a long-standing American tradition of arguments over religion, which ranges from uttering &ldquo;under God&rdquo; in the Pledge of Allegiance to displaying religious symbols ranging from crosses to the Ten Commandments on public land. The Air Force has long been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/23/politics/23academy.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">troubled</a> by religious tensions, especially at its Colorado academy.</p>
<p>But, according to Miller, this problem is of the Air Force&rsquo;s own making. Before last fall, Air Force regulations pertaining to the enlistment oath noted that &ldquo;airmen may omit the words `So help me God&rsquo;, if desired for personal reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a><img class="aligncenter size-portrait_small_2x wp-image-3319016" src="http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/oath-5-6-old1.png?w=560&#038;h=141" alt="oath-5.6 old" width="560" height="141"></a> But the Air Force modified that section last Oct. 30, according to Miller, and eliminated that option:</p>
<p><a><img class="aligncenter size-portrait_small_2x wp-image-3319005" src="http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/oath-5-6-new.png?w=560&#038;h=320" alt="oath-5.6-new" width="560" height="320"></a></p>
<p>Miller says she finds the Air Force&rsquo;s position surprising, because she handled a similar case last year for someone based at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. &ldquo;They said they&rsquo;d consulted their legal department, which confirmed that they could not require an atheist to say that language,&rdquo; Miller recalls. &ldquo;So it was very puzzling to us when this issue came up again a year later and the Air Force had a completely different response.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eugene Fidell, who lectures on military law at Yale University and co-founded the National Institute of Military Justice, says it shouldn&rsquo;t take long for the Department of Defense general counsel to strike down the requirement that airmen declare &ldquo;so help me God&rdquo; when they re-up. &ldquo;That provision cannot be considered mandatory,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clearly a test oath, and test oaths are forbidden by Article 6 of the Constitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bottom line of Article 6: &ldquo;&hellip;no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.&rdquo;</p></body></html>

<p>While Leahy, Pelosi, and the advocacy groups are not all united behind one solution, all have slammed the FCC&#8217;s current proposed rules on net neutrality, which were first presented in April and may be finalized as early as this year. The public comment period ends Sept. 15.</p>
<p>The FCC&rsquo;s proposed rules have been sharply criticized for allowing web companies to pay ISPs to deliver their content more quickly and in higher quality than companies that do not pay for faster service. Internet advocates argue that allowing such &#8220;paid prioritization&#8221;&mdash;widely known as Internet &ldquo;fast lanes&rdquo;&mdash;would give the richest incumbent companies, which can can afford to pay a premium, an unfair advantage over struggling start-ups and mom-and-pop operations that often operate on shoestring budgets.</p>
<p>Others worry that such fast lanes would fundamentally undermine the Wild West-style free market of ideas and commerce on the Internet, where you don&#8217;t have to be a billionaire to attract millions of new customers overnight to your site.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has insisted repeatedly that paid prioritization would help vital new industries that rely on lightning-fast download speeds, particularly in the e-medicine and online education spaces, to make their way online. Leahy will hold a Congressional hearing next week on the subject.</p>
<p>The Internet Association, an umbrella group uniting Silicon Valley&rsquo;s biggest, most powerful tech giants&mdash;including Google, Amazon, Facebook and Ebay&mdash;launched a new campaign Wednesday afternoon. It includes a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC3WYNh2fQQ" target="_blank">video</a> and an <a href="http://internetassociation.org/091014netneutrality/" target="_blank">online comic</a> demanding better net neutrality protections. The association also submitted formal <a href="http://internetassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TIA-Open-Internet-Reply-Comments.pdf" target="_blank">comments</a> (PDF) to the FCC warning the agency to ignore the &#8220;flawed arguments of broadband gatekeepers that seek to control speech on the Internet, censor content, and segregate the Internet into fast and slow lanes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Internet Association&rsquo;s position on net neutrality is particularly important in the public dialogue because its member companies are mainly large incumbents that could theoretically benefit from paid prioritization deals edging out their smaller competitors. Instead, these large companies have insisted that the Internet marketplace must remain friendly to the tiniest start-ups, which are often the source of &#8220;the next big thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another coalition of Internet advocates convened Wednesday behind a different, similar campaign, <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/">Battle for the Net</a>, which is also critical of the FCC&rsquo;s proposed rules and calls for better ones. Battle for the Net includes 27 progressive advocacy organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and MoveOn.org, as well as dozens of tech companies, including Twitter, Tumblr, Netflix, Kickstarter, Etsy, and Vimeo.</p>
<p>Those companies, along with thousands of smaller websites, took part in a &ldquo;day of action&rdquo; Wednesday in which they <a href="https://imgur.com/a/KHnr7" target="_blank">displayed on their home pages </a>an icon symbolizing a slow-loading website. When visitors click on that icon, they are invited to sign the Battle for the Net&rsquo;s letter to the FCC and to contact their member of Congress.</p>
<p>While the Battle for the Net coalition&rsquo;s gripes are similar to those of the Internet Association, the Battle for the Net goes farther in pointing at a specific solution. It, along with Pelosi, asks that the FCC categorize ISPs as a &ldquo;Title II&rdquo; industry, a move that would give the agency legal jurisdiction to strictly regulate the companies that own the Internet &#8220;pipes&#8221; &mdash; or the fiber that the Internet runs on. The Internet Association, while leaving what is known as the &ldquo;Title II option&rdquo; on the table, has stopped short of actively advocating for that end.</p>
<p>The debate over net neutrality is at this point intrinsically intertwined with a discussion of the Title II option, which itself hinges on a rather arcane detail in administrative law. In January, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the FCC&rsquo;s previous rules on net neutrality on the grounds that the agency does not have legal jurisdiction over ISPs since they do not fall under &ldquo;Title II&rdquo; of the regulators&rsquo; statute. Public advocacy groups, like Free Press, which organized Battle for the Net, argue that the FCC should simply fix that problem, since it&#8217;s up to the agency to decide how it categorizes different industries.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s where the discussion really heats up. Big ISPs, like Comcast, Verizon and Time Warner Cable, as well as their trade associations, have said that the Title II option, which would allow the FCC to treat ISPs like telephone companies, would <a href="https://www.ncta.com/platform/public-policy/regulating-broadband-under-title-ii-is-not-highly-deregulatory/" target="_blank">unleash a storm</a> of suffocating regulation. They say that if they are regulated &ldquo;like public utilities,&rdquo; they would have no incentive to invest hundreds of millions every year in researching and developing new technologies, much less maintaining and improving the network of pipes and wires that connect American homes to the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Advocates for the Title II option say the ISPs, which enjoy monopolies and duopolies in most American cities and towns, <em>should</em> be regulated strictly, but argue that categorizing ISPs under Title II would actually lead to <em>fewer</em> regulations. The categorization would allow the FCC to pass a simple, blanket, easy-to-enforce rule on net neutrality for all ISPs, they say, rather than going at it piecemeal. Some advocates say that by avoiding the Title II option, the FCC is wading into unnecessary red tape. The agency&#8217;s current proposed rules call for the formation of a special ombudsman office within the FCC where federal bureaucrats would manually review when web companies paid ISPs for premium service.</p>
<p>The issue of net neutrality rocketed into national headlines earlier this year after Netflix accused big ISPs, like Comcast and Verizon, of deliberately slowing down streaming speeds and causing streaming videos to buffer. After Netflix paid the ISPs a fee, the download speeds increased. ISPs say such deals are only fair now that a handful of companies, like Netflix and Google&#8217;s YouTube, dominate the majority of web traffic during primetime hours.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear when exactly the debate surrounding net neutrality will end. The FCC could finalize its proposed rules on net neutrality in the next few months or, if public pressure mounts, it could be forced to return to the drawing board early next year. President Obama, who has been a vociferous advocate for net neutrality&#8211;and a critic of &#8220;fast lanes&#8221; on the Internet&#8211;has stopped short, but <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/08/05/obama-strikes-a-populist-tone-on-net-neutrality/">just barely</a>, of condemning the FCC&#8217;s proposed rules.</p>
<p>With rising populist anger, a raft of new PR campaigns, and Silicon Valley tech firms set to be major political campaign contributors in 2016, something&#8217;s likely to break soon.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3318521"></div></aside>

<p>Davis was propelled to national prominence overnight, and she&rsquo;s now making a long shot bid for governor of Texas. But before her 2013 filibuster&mdash;which, she tells TIME, is not even the most important filibuster she&rsquo;s staged&mdash;Davis was the daughter of a single mom and a single mom herself, experiences she has written about in her memoir <em>Forgetting to be Afraid</em>, released this week.</p>
<p>She spoke to TIME about her struggle to get a college degree, her fight for reproductive rights, and her favorite ice cream (it&#8217;s Rocky Road).</p>
<p><strong>TIME: Your memoir is called<em> Forgetting to be Afraid.</em> What inspired the title?</strong></p>
<p>Wendy Davis: It was inspired by a Lady Bird Johnson quote. She was asked at least on one occasion by a group of young women how it is that she pushed through fear to do things, because she was inherently a very shy person. She advised them that you have to get so wrapped up in something you forget to be afraid. My whole life story can be captured through that idea. I had to make a way out of no way for myself and my daughter. Due to the fact that I was so wrapped up in trying to do that, I forgot to be afraid of doing it. Along every step of my journey I think that that sentiment really captures how it is that I&rsquo;ve pushed through fear, put my head down and done what I needed to do.</p>
<p><strong>Are you inherently shy yourself?</strong></p>
<p>I was a very shy child. And I talk in the book about moving from being very shy to being a fighter and that shift really came from the need to fight first for myself and my daughter and then next in the public service arena for people who don&rsquo;t have the same opportunities that I had in a myriad of ways.</p>
<p><strong>In your book you write about your decision to terminate two pregnancies for medical reasons. Did that motivate your filibuster against the Texas abortion bill?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly my personal experience in that regard was part of what I want people to know about me in hopes that it might help people struggling with the same situation. But my stand for reproductive rights in Texas was primarily motivated by my understanding of the harm that would come to women across our state if they were denied access to safe reproductive care. I have always firmly believed that women should be trusted to make decisions for themselves with their family, their faith, their doctor, and that the government has no business intruding in that most private arena. I fought that day for women, and men who love them, whose voices had been cut out of the process. In committee hearings at the state legislature there were so many people that had signed up to speak and been told after several hours that their testimony was repetitive and they were cut off. I wanted to give voice to the people who felt like they&rsquo;d not been heard.</p>
<p><strong>But those restrictions were eventually passed. In fact, restrictions on abortion have been tightened across the state.</strong></p>
<p>The first provision, which required that doctors have admitting privileges (to a hospital) within 30 miles of an abortion clinic was implemented right away. It immediately caused 21 of the 40 clinics in Texas to close. The second provision was set to go into effect on [Sept. 1] but a federal judge ruled the law in its entirety unconstitutional. As a consequence of that and while it&rsquo;s on appeal at the 5th circuit I know that some of those health centers are considering reopening, some are waiting to see what the 5th circuit will do.</p>
<p><strong>Was the filibuster your defining moment as a politician?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of the people know about my filibuster last summer but as important if not more to me was my filibuster in 2011 to try to stop $5.5 billion from being cut from our public schools and try to stop a dramatic reduction in financial assistance for our students trying to go to a state university. Access to opportunity comes through education and that is my primary passion and fight. And it&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m running for governor.</p>
<p><strong>You have daughters aged 32 and 25. Do you feel hopeful about their future?</strong></p>
<p>What I see when I look at them is the fact that their mother broke through and got a college degree created a path for them to logically follow. I think about how fortunate they are that they have the ability to do that and I think about all of the other young girls in Texas who are those first generation college students like me who don&rsquo;t have the same path available to them. It&rsquo;s that concern that motivates me most.</p>
<p><strong>According to your book, your mom worked at the ice cream chain Braum&rsquo;s. I love Braum&rsquo;s! I grew up in Tulsa.</strong></p>
<p>You did? Well, Texas is all about Whataburger. Oklahoma is all about Braum&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><strong>But your mom worked at Braum&rsquo;s! Does this make you a traitor to Braum&#8217;s?</strong></p>
<p>No, I still crave a Braum&rsquo;s hamburger every now and then for sure.</p>

    <h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">As Obama prepares to address nation about ISIS strategy</h2>
    <p><strong>Correction appended, Sept. 10</strong></p>
<p>A record proportion of Americans feel less safe now than they did before than Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, according to <a href="http://newscms.nbcnews.com/sites/newscms/files/14901_september_nbc-wsj_poll.pdf" target="_blank">a new poll</a>.</p>
<p>The NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey found that 47% of Americans feel less safe than they did before 9/11. And a record low, 26%, feel they are safer since 9/11.</p>
<p>The sobering results come with President Barack Obama set to address Americans in an address Wednesday night about one of their fears: the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS). Almost two-thirds of Americans think confronting the group is in the country&#8217;s best interests, according to the poll. A majority of Americans, 59%, have closely paid attention to the conflict the group is waging in Iraq and Syria, reading &#8220;a lot&#8221; of news coverage about the beheading of American journalists by ISIS. When asked if the U.S. military effort should be &#8220;limited to air strikes only,&#8221; 40% of Americans said yes, while 34% of Americans support combat troops on the ground.</p>
<p>The poll found a record low approval rating for Obama&#8217;s handling of foreign policy, at just 32%.</p>
<p>The survey of 1,000 registered voters was conducted Sept. 3-7 and has a margin of error of about 3 percentage points.</p>
<p><em>Correction: The original version of this story misstated the year of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</em></p>

To Jay Rogers, the company&rsquo;s co-founder and CEO, it was a perfect combo. SEMA is the premier event for automotive specialty products makers, says Rogers, and Las Vegas gave his Rally Fighters&mdash;low-slung beauties that look something like Ford Mustangs on steroids&mdash;a chance to really strut their stuff.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Rally Fighters are designed for off-road racing as well as regular street driving,&rdquo; says Rogers, &ldquo;so where better to display them than in Las Vegas, where the streets stretch out to majestic desert sands?&rdquo; The city exudes &ldquo;a feeling of freedom, vitality and originality,&rdquo; he adds, the very things his customers prize.<\/p>\n<p>Rogers, a former Marine, a Harvard Business School graduate and grandson of the owner of the iconic Indian Motorcycle Co., has created a radically different kind of company that prefers open-source, bespoke manufacturing to the Henry Ford style of assembly line operations.

CEO Tom Nix has had a long-term love affair with Las Vegas, which is not surprising. Scala is a leader in digital signage and display software, and Las Vegas is arguably the digital signage capital of the world. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wow factor when you walk down the street in Vegas,&rdquo; says Nix, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s all about how people receive and interact with visual information.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>His company has a lot to do with making Las Vegas sparkle, and vice versa. The software maker counts on the city&rsquo;s trade shows and meetings to promote its wares and focus attention on digital media&rsquo;s vast and growing potential. Scala&rsquo;s huge exhibit at Las Vegas&rsquo; annual Digital Signage Expo showcases cutting-edge communications for such varied industries as retail, transportation and hospitality.<\/p>\n<p>Nix also sees Las Vegas as the ideal place to get customers and colleagues thinking about digital communication solutions to the challenge of information overload. &ldquo;Casinos like Harrah&rsquo;s leverage their data to deliver a very personalized customer experience through membership clubs and customer relationship programs,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of Scala&rsquo;s DNA&mdash;personalizing data on a screen, whether for a shopper in a store or for people in a corporate environment. We can take existing data from a platform like Salesforce.com and display it with broadcast quality.&rdquo; That capability, Nix argues, enables companies to cut through the information clutter and keep employees focused on key performance goals in sales, customer relationship management, production or other areas.<\/p>\n<p>Scala software powers digital signs worldwide, but the company sees Las Vegas as a uniquely effective showplace because of its electric atmosphere. &ldquo;Las Vegas is great fun,&rdquo; Nix says, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s significant. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve gone to Las Vegas expecting to meet with business acquaintances, only to leave there realizing that those people had become real friends.&rdquo;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-11887\"><\/div><\/aside>","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/2011-vegasstrip-7-3102011-scala.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/2011-vegasstrip-7-3102011-scala.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/2011-vegasstrip-7-3102011-scala.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/2011-vegasstrip-7-3102011-scala.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/2011-vegasstrip-7-3102011-scala.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"StockPhotosforFree.com","caption":"","alt":""},"id":11887,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F11887%2Fvegas-eye-candy%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1g5g3S2","encoded_title":"Vegas+Eye+Candy","twitter_text":"Vegas%20Eye%20Candy","twitter_via":"TIME","sponsor":{"name":"LVCVA","slug":"lvcva","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/lvcva-logo1.jpg?w=53","color":"#000000"},"email_title":"Vegas%20Eye%20Candy%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Vegas%20Eye%20Candy%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F11887%2Fvegas-eye-candy%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/content-from\/lvcva\/11888\/office-massage-comfort-in-vegas\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1c2g5yf","title":"Office Massage &amp; Comfort in Vegas","post_type":"time_sponsored_post","short_title":"Office Massage &amp; Comfort in Vegas","time":{"pretty":"March 2, 2014","published":"2014-03-02 16:45:19","updated":"2014-03-02 21:45:19","minute":"4:45 pm","short":"3\/2"},"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-11888\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p><b><br \/>\nLas Vegas offers a great marketing platform for ErgoExpo, the ergonomics industry&rsquo;s major event<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Like all successful trade shows, ErgoExpo&mdash;more formally, the National Ergonomics Conference and ErgoExpo&mdash;is a galvanizing force for the industry it serves. Held each year at Las Vegas&rsquo; Caesars Palace, it attracts 1,500 human resources executives, designers, health care providers and professional ergonomists, plus everyone from name-brand manufacturers like Microsoft and Steelcase to single-product startups.<\/p>\n<p>What gives the 19-year-old ErgoExpo its clout? First, it&rsquo;s where the action is. Ergonomics, the science of fitting workplace conditions and job demands to the capabilities of the working population, is top of mind everywhere. &ldquo;We showcase the extraordinary research being done on every aspect of workplace injury and worker productivity,&rdquo; says Walter Charnizon, managing director of LRP Conferences, owners of ErgoExpo.<\/p>\n<p>Second, it provides incomparable networking opportunities. &ldquo;Each year, I meet exhibitors with small family businesses who tell me they get goose bumps from all the business opportunities they find,&rdquo; says Charnizon. ErgoExpo also gives manufacturers of all sizes a window on new marketing opportunities&mdash;for instance, an FBI management and program analyst who came to a recent event seeking ergonomic advice on setting up and furnishing a new multimillion-dollar field office.<\/p>\n<p>All attendees come to ErgoExpo to inspect the latest in such ergonomically important areas, from adjustable keyboards to zero-gravity lifts. The point of the conference and expo, says Charnizon, is to highlight state-of-the-art ergonomics while making the industry more accessible and synergistic: &ldquo;We bring together people tasked with adjusting to the changing nature of the workplace and the workforce.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Before moving ErgoExpo to Las Vegas 11 years ago, Charnizon&rsquo;s firm staged the meeting at three other venues, none of which proved nearly as effective. &ldquo;Las Vegas gets our business,&rdquo; Charnizon says. &ldquo;Every aspect of the city is geared to the highest level of hospitality and accommodation. Las Vegas is focused on helping people like me do business, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s the conference and meeting center of the universe.&rdquo;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-11888\"><\/div><\/aside>","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/pm_convention-center_s01a6894_1_3c-reduced.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/pm_convention-center_s01a6894_1_3c-reduced.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/pm_convention-center_s01a6894_1_3c-reduced.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/pm_convention-center_s01a6894_1_3c-reduced.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/pm_convention-center_s01a6894_1_3c-reduced.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"","caption":"","alt":""},"id":11888,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F11888%2Foffice-massage-comfort-in-vegas%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1c2g5yf","encoded_title":"Office+Massage+%26+Comfort+in+Vegas","twitter_text":"Office%20Massage%20%26%20Comfort%20in%20Vegas","twitter_via":"TIME","sponsor":{"name":"LVCVA","slug":"lvcva","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/lvcva-logo1.jpg?w=53","color":"#000000"},"email_title":"Office%20Massage%20%26%20Comfort%20in%20Vegas%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Office%20Massage%20%26%20Comfort%20in%20Vegas%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F11888%2Foffice-massage-comfort-in-vegas%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/content-from\/lvcva\/11886\/the-biggest-spectacle-in-vegas-is-not-what-you-think\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1pWDYLo","title":"The Biggest Spectacle In Vegas Is Not What You Think","post_type":"time_sponsored_post","short_title":"The Biggest Spectacle In Vegas Is Not What You Think","time":{"pretty":"March 1, 2014","published":"2014-03-01 16:45:09","updated":"2014-03-01 21:45:09","minute":"4:45 pm","short":"3\/1"},"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-11886\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p><b><br \/>\nLas Vegas is the best place in America for showcasing products and ideas<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Sony Electronics is more than a familiar consumer brand; it&rsquo;s one of the most innovative names in consumer and professional electronics. Moviemakers and TV studios, for example, use Sony gear to capture and edit content. The company&rsquo;s professional division also makes digital signage, security systems and an array of other ultrasophisticated electronics. Sony&rsquo;s advertising sums up the overriding philosophy: &ldquo;Believe that anything you can imagine, you can make real.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Nowhere does that message resonate more clearly than at the eight to 10 spectacular trade show exhibitions that Sony mounts yearly in Las Vegas, North America&rsquo;s top trade show venue. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no better place on earth to showcase your wares,&rdquo; says John Kaloukian, Sony Electronics vice president of U.S. sales. &ldquo;Las Vegas has everything you need to make the right impression on your customers and then to entertain them royally.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Sony makes giant splashes at two premier Las Vegas events: the annual Consumer Electronics Show held each January, and the NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) Show in April. Sony&rsquo;s massive (up to 26,000 square feet) booths at the two events are typically double the size of the shows&rsquo; next-largest installations. At a recent NAB Show, Sony&rsquo;s booth featured a 53-foot production trailer&mdash;the kind you see parked outside major sports events. Guests strolled through the truck&rsquo;s interior, inspecting each cutting-edge piece of equipment.<\/p>\n<p>The company also participates in several more specialized Las Vegas events, such as InfoComm and the Digital Signage Expo, aimed at specific segments of the commercial electronics market. &ldquo;Our first goal,&rdquo; says Kaloukian, &ldquo;is to get customers to spend time with our engineers and sales and marketing team to get an overview of the products and solutions that Sony offers, along with some of our future technologies. Las Vegas is ideal for that. Not only are its convention facilities unsurpassed, but it&rsquo;s a place our customers really love visiting.&rdquo;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-11886\"><\/div><\/aside>","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/sony_dsc08552-large.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/sony_dsc08552-large.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/sony_dsc08552-large.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/sony_dsc08552-large.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/sony_dsc08552-large.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"SONY","caption":"","alt":""},"id":11886,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F11886%2Fthe-biggest-spectacle-in-vegas-is-not-what-you-think%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1pWDYLo","encoded_title":"The+Biggest+Spectacle+In+Vegas+Is+Not+What+You+Think","twitter_text":"The%20Biggest%20Spectacle%20In%20Vegas%20Is%20Not%20What%20You%20Think","twitter_via":"TIME","sponsor":{"name":"LVCVA","slug":"lvcva","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/lvcva-logo1.jpg?w=53","color":"#000000"},"email_title":"The%20Biggest%20Spectacle%20In%20Vegas%20Is%20Not%20What%20You%20Think%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"The%20Biggest%20Spectacle%20In%20Vegas%20Is%20Not%20What%20You%20Think%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Flvcva%2F11886%2Fthe-biggest-spectacle-in-vegas-is-not-what-you-think%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/content-from\/lvcva\/11772\/why-the-secret-to-success-is-located-in-the-heart-of-vegas\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1fCPust","title":"Why The Secret To Success Is Located In The Heart Of Vegas","post_type":"time_sponsored_post","short_title":"Why The Secret To Success Is Located In The Heart Of Vegas","time":{"pretty":"Feb. 28, 2014","published":"2014-02-28 16:44:59","updated":"2014-02-28 21:44:59","minute":"4:44 pm","short":"2\/28"},"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-11772\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p><b><br \/>\nMeetings and conventions in Las Vegas give companies remarkable bang for their marketing bucks<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Cobra Electronics, a longtime leader in consumer communications gear, has a simple marketing secret: Instead of lavish consumer advertising, the Chicago-based company focuses on trade shows held in the place where important customers, bankers and other key industry figures are most likely to see them&mdash;Las Vegas.<\/p>\n<p>At the giant annual International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) a few years ago, Microsoft founder Bill Gates happened by Cobra&rsquo;s 3,300-square-foot booth and spent 20 minutes chatting with Cobra Chairman and CEO Jim Bazet. <i>Good Morning America<\/i> had set up its cameras inside Cobra&rsquo;s booth, and reporters from virtually all the major news media passed by regularly. &ldquo;Where else,&rdquo; asked Bazet at the time, &ldquo;could a $100 million company get such valuable exposure?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Cobra is a global leader in CB radios, radar detection and two-way radios. Recent innovations include the world&rsquo;s smallest and most powerful radar detector, and the first touch-screen radar, laser and safety camera detector. Cobra displays these and other products at the International CES and at several smaller, more specialized Las Vegas trade shows. Dozens of Cobra&rsquo;s top people attend these shows, reasoning that there&rsquo;s no more effective place to interact with customers, bankers, industry analysts and the media.<\/p>\n<p>Besides its superb meeting facilities, the city offers unique opportunities for entertainment and recreation, from great golf courses to many of the nation&rsquo;s finest restaurants. And behind the scenes, Las Vegas has an unusual wealth of experienced and knowledgeable event planners, plus highly creative design and production specialists.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;People are happier going to Las Vegas than to any other meeting site,&rdquo; says Bazet. &ldquo;They come to Las Vegas expecting fun, which is the true reason meetings there are so successful. Las Vegas is a premier global attraction, yet it&rsquo;s also the easiest, most effective place to hold a meeting that I know.&rdquo;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\"

Obama will signal the expansion of those efforts to a campaign &#8220;to take out [ISIS] wherever they exist using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years,&#8221; Obama will say.<\/p>\n<p>No American troops will be involved in direct combat against ISIS on the ground, Obama will reaffirm, but more than 1,000 U.S. forces are in Iraq protecting American facilities and advising and training Iraqi and Kurdish forces.<\/p>\n<p>Secretary of State John Kerry is traveling the region this week to build the international coalition Obama is seeking to take on ISIS. At the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Wales last week, Obama secured the support of many U.S. allies to assist in the effort against the group.<\/p>\n<p>American officials have repeatedly said they are not aware of any active plots by ISIS against the U.S. homeland, but they are concerned by the thousands of foreign fighters, including more than 100 Americans, who are believed to be battling alongside ISIS and could return to the United States to carry out attacks in the future.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3319522\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/"},"tag":{"name":"Foreign Policy","slug":"foreign-policy","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/foreign-policy\/"},"tags":"Foreign Policy","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/president-barack-obama1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/president-barack-obama1.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/president-barack-obama1.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/president-barack-obama1.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/president-barack-obama1.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Charles Dharapak\u2014AP","caption":"President Barack Obama speaks at a news conference at the NATO summit at Celtic Manor, Newport, Wales, Sept. 5, 2014.

Alex Salmond, Scotland&rsquo;s First Minister spearheading the campaign, has said his deputy Nicola Sturgeon would lead the negotiation talks on behalf of the Scottish nationalists. Westminster has not yet announced who would lead its team.<\/p>\n<p><b>Would the United Kingdom have to change its name?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Whereas the name &#8220;Great Britain&#8221; refers to a geographical union, the &#8220;United Kingdom&#8221; refers to a political one, taking its name from the 1707 Act of Union. If Scotland becomes independent, it&#8217;s possible that both names may change, though in reality the country could (and probably would) keep the names. The handle &#8220;the rest of the U.K.&#8221;, typically abbreviated to rU.K., has been used frequently, though both &#8220;continuing U.K.&#8221;and &#8220;Future U.K.&#8221; have been floated as options.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Would Scotland be in the European Union?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Eventually, yes. According to the pro-independence campaign, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yesscotland.net\/answers\/will-scotland-be-european-union%20\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Scotland&#8217;s EU membership will be secure&#8221;<\/a> by the time of independence. But it may not be as quick or straightforward as the &#8220;Yes&#8221; campaign has said. EU treaties do not specify a protocol for a member state breaking apart, and Brussels has said that Scotland will probably have to apply to join. This process will be slowed by debate over whether Scotland could opt out of the EU&rsquo;s single currency zone (since all EU member states have to join the euro once the necessary conditions are fulfilled) and by concerns from countries like Spain and Belgium who face pressure from their own secessionist movements. Since EU policies and legal regulations already apply in Scotland, the majority of negotiations shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult. However, while Salmond claims the transition to EU member state can be done within 18 months, waiting for approval from all 28 countries is likely to take considerably longer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would independence mean for Scotland&rsquo;s defense force and for NATO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign supports continued membership of NATO, but Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/tto\/news\/uk\/defence\/article4180414.ece\" target=\"_blank\">has said<\/a> an independent Scotland would not be guaranteed an automatic place in the defense organization. Scotland would have to reapply to NATO as a new state and all 28 member states would need to unanimously agree on enlargement. The process could take years.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, Scottish nationalists are opposed to having the U.K&#8217;s nuclear arsenal at its Faslane naval base on the west coast of Scotland and would like to see it removed as soon as possible. If Scotland votes yes, the SNP intends to remove both the Trident nuclear deterrent and nuclear warheads in nearby Loch Long by 2020. Since there are no clear alternative naval bases in the U.K. for the Trident submarines, their transfer to another part of Britain would be inevitably difficult, lengthy and expensive. In fact, the Henry Jackson Society think tank <a href=\"http:\/\/henryjacksonsociety.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/HJS-In-Scotlands-Defence-Report-LOW-RES.pdf%20\" target=\"_blank\">argues that <\/a>Scottish independence could unilaterally disarm the rest of the U.K., essentially requiring an abandonment of its nuclear program.<\/p>\n<div>Given that NATO is fundamentally a nuclear alliance, U.K. ministers have warned that Scotland&rsquo;s application could be vetoed if the SNP pursues its pledge to ban nuclear weapons on Scottish. Des Browne, former Secretary of State for Defense and Scotland, says &ldquo;a vote to leave the UK is a vote to leave Nato, the most successful defense and security alliance in the world.&rdquo;<\/div>\n<p><strong>Would David Cameron have to resign?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Prime Minister has said he &#8220;emphatically&#8221; would not resign if Scotland decides to leave the U.K. Nonetheless, he would certainly be under great pressure to do so from both his own party (who are technically still the &lsquo;Conservative and Unionist party&rsquo;) and the opposition. Senior party members have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/politics\/david-cameron\/11082875\/David-Cameron-is-in-serious-trouble-with-his-party-over-the-referendum-warn-Tory-MPs.html\" target=\"_blank\">suggested<\/a> Cameron may face a parliamentary vote of no confidence in the wake of the referendum<strong>,<\/strong> possibly just for allowing the referendum to take place.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Would there still be a U.K. General Election in May 2015? Would Scottish voters be able to take part?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There has been talk of delaying the General Election to prohibit Scottish voters from choosing the government of a union it intends to leave. Postponing remains unlikely because, bar one exception during World War II, parliamentary terms in the U.K. are always fixed at a maximum of five years. Scottish voters would still be able to participate but their representatives would serve only a 10-month term in office since Scottish MPs would have to leave Westminster on Independence Day in March 2016.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would that change the makeup of the U.K. parliament?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The impact on future electoral outcomes without Scotland has been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/business\/publications\/research\/scotland-the-referendum-and-independence\/impact-on-the-uk-parliament\/%20\" target=\"_blank\">heavily discussed<\/a>, with suggestions of a hung parliament if Scottish MPs are excluded. But <a href=\"http:\/\/wingsoverscotland.com\/why-labour-doesnt-need-scotland\/%20\" target=\"_blank\">an analysis<\/a> of General Election results since the end of World War II shows that Scottish MPs have had a practical influence over the composition of the U.K. government on just three occasions. Scottish MPs turned a Conservative government into a Labour one with a wafer-thin majority of 4 in 1964 and a majority of 3 in 1974. In 2010, Scotland prevented the Conservatives from winning by an outright majority, compelling them to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. Of the current existing 59 Scottish seats, the Conservatives have only 1, the Liberal Democrats have 11 and Labour have 41. While Scotland could be critical to Labour&rsquo;s ability to win an overall majority in 2015, past results suggest that the election in 2015 really depends on support in the rest of the U.K. for Ed Miliband&rsquo;s Labour campaign.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What currency would an independent Scotland use?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although Salmond has insisted that Scotland would keep the pound sterling, the three main Westminster parties (Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrats) have ruled out a currency union. Other possibilities for Scotland include sterlingization (the use of the pound but outside a formal union, which could diminish financial security), joining the euro or creating a new currency.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would happen to the U.K. national debt? How much would be transferred to Scotland?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is yet to be decided. It is likely to be calculated on a per capita basis, according to population size.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would happen to benefits and taxes?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Both benefits and taxes would become the responsibility of the new Scottish government. The Scottish Parliament would ensure that the personal tax allowance and tax credits increase in line with inflation. Tax would stay the same until a new government, elected in 2016, chooses how to change it. However, wide variations in forecasts for the revenue of an independent Scotland make it difficult to calculate potential changes for the individual taxpayer. The pro-union side has challenged the SNP&rsquo;s plan for the benefits system, arguing that uncertainty is the inevitable outcome and that Scotland&#8217;s benefits would be more secure if it remained part of the U.K.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would happen to Scotland&rsquo;s businesses?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The oil revenues in the North Sea have always been considered essential to the economic viability of Scotland as an independent nation state. The figures propounded by the Yes campaign about the quantity of oil and gas reserves (Salmond estimates &pound;1.5 trillion pounds ($2.5tn) remain) have proved one of the most contentious points of the independence debates. While Salmond has asserted oil would support the country &ldquo;way beyond 2050&rdquo;, Sir Ian Wood, a leading Scottish oil executive and industry expert, asserts that Salmond is overestimating the remaining reserves by 45 &ndash; 60%. BP, the major oil company employing over 4,000 people in the North Sea region, released a statement Wednesday in support of Wood&rsquo;s claims and urging Scotland to vote against independence.<\/p>\n<p>Standard Life, the pensions and insurance giant based in the Scottish capital Edinburgh, has warned that it would move large parts of its business out of Scotland in order to protect its customers in the event of secession. As a contingency plan, Standard Life has started registering new English subsidiaries to which it could transfer parts of its business. Neither the Royal Bank of Scotland nor Lloyds Banking Group have announced yet that they would move their main bases to London, but companies would have 18 months until official independence to make any decisions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Would Scottish citizens need new passports?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This largely depends on whether Scotland can join the EU. Scottish citizens would be entitled to a Scottish passport, but a U.K. passport would still be valid until it expires. British citizens &#8220;habitually resident&#8221; in Scotland would be automatically considered Scottish citizens and qualify to apply for Scottish passports.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Would passports be needed to cross the England-Scotland border?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An independent Scotland would be responsible for its own borders, but the Scottish government has signaled that it would not want to sign up to the Schengen free-travel area which covers much of western Europe. As far as the rest of the U.K. is concerned, Home Secretary Theresa May has warned that independence would lead to &ldquo;profound changes for migration policy.&rdquo; Scotland&rsquo;s plan to pursue &ldquo;healthy population growth&rdquo; has been interpreted as implying a looser immigration policy. The Conservatives, who prefer a harder line on immigration, have expressed concerns at the possibility of Scotland becoming &ldquo;a convenient landing point for migration into the United Kingdom.&rdquo; From Westminster&rsquo;s point of view, border controls and passport checks are a real possibility.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Would Scotland keep the Queen?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign has said that Her Majesty would remain as monarch, since the referendum concerns the 1707 Union of the Nations, as opposed to the 1603 Union of the Crowns. Buckingham Palace <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29136149\" target=\"_blank\">insists that<\/a> the Queen is politically neutral and that she will not be intervening in the independence debate. In the short term, Scotland&rsquo;s draft constitution would keep the Queen as Queen of Scotland, but there could well be another referendum on the subject.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3318806\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/"},"tag":{"name":"United Kingdom","slug":"united-kingdom","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/united-kingdom\/"},"tags":"Scotland|United Kingdom","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/rtr4590g.jpg?crop=714px%2C82px%2C1600px%2C1600px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/rtr4590g.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/rtr4590g.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/rtr4590g.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/rtr4590g.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Russell Cheyne\u2014Reuters","caption":"The flag of Scotland, the Saltire, blows in the wind near Berwick-upon-Tweed on the border between England and Scotland on Sept. 7, 2014 ","alt":"The Flag of Scotland, the Saltire, blows in the wind near Berwick-upon-Tweed on the border between England and Scotland"},"id":3318806,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3318806%2Fscotland-independence-guide%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1txQIIh","encoded_title":"What+Happens+If+Scotland+Votes+For+Independence%3F","twitter_text":"Here%27s%20what%20would%20happen%20if%20Scotland%20votes%20for%20independence","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"What Happens If Scotland Votes For Independence?"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"What Happens If Scotland Votes For Independence?"},"email_title":"What%20Happens%20If%20Scotland%20Votes%20For%20Independence%3F%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"What%20Happens%20If%20Scotland%20Votes%20For%20Independence%3F%0A%0AA%20guide%20to%20what%20would%20happen%20if%20Scotland%20voted%20to%20leave%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20on%20Sept.%2018%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3318806%2Fscotland-independence-guide%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-mag|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3319344\/net-neutrality-congress-fcc\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/Yy4yS5","title":"Net Neutrality Campaign Claims Victory in &#8216;Battle for the Net&#8217;","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Congress: Ok, Ok, We Hear You On Net Neutrality","excerpt":"But the war over internet freedom isn't over","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"6:09 PM ET","published":"2014-09-10 18:09:15","updated":"2014-09-10 22:09:15","minute":"6:09 pm","short":"6:09 PM ET"},"authors":[{"id":221261783,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/haley-sweetland-edwards\/","name":"Haley Sweetland Edwards","bio":"","twitter":"","twitter_url":"","gplus":"","fb":"","email":"","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/voss-timeheadshots37final.jpg?crop=1052px%2C180px%2C3257px%2C3257px&resize=100%2C100"}],"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-3319344\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p>A coalition of tech companies and Open Internet activists claimed victory Wednesday evening after a day-long campaign, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.battleforthenet.com\/sept10th\/\" target=\"_blank\">Battle for the Net<\/a>, succeeded in swamping the federal government with millions of public comments demanding that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) scrap its proposed rules governing net neutrality and write new ones.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-partner\" data-name=\"rr-partner\"><div class=\"read-more-list\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3319153\/apple-watch-kids-parents-unite\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Parents, Unite!

She says she will file suit in the case in federal court later this month if the Air Force continues to insist on her client swearing the oath.<\/p>\n<p>The latest skirmish is part of a long-standing American tradition of arguments over religion, which ranges from uttering &ldquo;under God&rdquo; in the Pledge of Allegiance to displaying religious symbols ranging from crosses to the Ten Commandments on public land. The Air Force has long been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2005\/06\/23\/politics\/23academy.html?pagewanted=all\" target=\"_blank\">troubled<\/a> by religious tensions, especially at its Colorado academy.<\/p>\n<p>But, according to Miller, this problem is of the Air Force&rsquo;s own making.

The public comment period ends Sept. 15.<\/p>\n<p>The FCC&rsquo;s proposed rules have been sharply criticized for allowing web companies to pay ISPs to deliver their content more quickly and in higher quality than companies that do not pay for faster service. Internet advocates argue that allowing such &#8220;paid prioritization&#8221;&mdash;widely known as Internet &ldquo;fast lanes&rdquo;&mdash;would give the richest incumbent companies, which can can afford to pay a premium, an unfair advantage over struggling start-ups and mom-and-pop operations that often operate on shoestring budgets.<\/p>\n<p>Others worry that such fast lanes would fundamentally undermine the Wild West-style free market of ideas and commerce on the Internet, where you don&#8217;t have to be a billionaire to attract millions of new customers overnight to your site.<\/p>\n<p>FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has insisted repeatedly that paid prioritization would help vital new industries that rely on lightning-fast download speeds, particularly in the e-medicine and online education spaces, to make their way online. Leahy will hold a Congressional hearing next week on the subject.<\/p>\n<p>The Internet Association, an umbrella group uniting Silicon Valley&rsquo;s biggest, most powerful tech giants&mdash;including Google, Amazon, Facebook and Ebay&mdash;launched a new campaign Wednesday afternoon. It includes a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XC3WYNh2fQQ\" target=\"_blank\">video<\/a> and an <a href=\"http:\/\/internetassociation.org\/091014netneutrality\/\" target=\"_blank\">online comic<\/a> demanding better net neutrality protections. The association also submitted formal <a href=\"http:\/\/internetassociation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/TIA-Open-Internet-Reply-Comments.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">comments<\/a> (PDF) to the FCC warning the agency to ignore the &#8220;flawed arguments of broadband gatekeepers that seek to control speech on the Internet, censor content, and segregate the Internet into fast and slow lanes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Internet Association&rsquo;s position on net neutrality is particularly important in the public dialogue because its member companies are mainly large incumbents that could theoretically benefit from paid prioritization deals edging out their smaller competitors. Instead, these large companies have insisted that the Internet marketplace must remain friendly to the tiniest start-ups, which are often the source of &#8220;the next big thing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, another coalition of Internet advocates convened Wednesday behind a different, similar campaign, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.battleforthenet.com\/sept10th\/\">Battle for the Net<\/a>, which is also critical of the FCC&rsquo;s proposed rules and calls for better ones. Battle for the Net includes 27 progressive advocacy organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and MoveOn.org, as well as dozens of tech companies, including Twitter, Tumblr, Netflix, Kickstarter, Etsy, and Vimeo.<\/p>\n<p>Those companies, along with thousands of smaller websites, took part in a &ldquo;day of action&rdquo; Wednesday in which they <a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/KHnr7\" target=\"_blank\">displayed on their home pages <\/a>an icon symbolizing a slow-loading website. When visitors click on that icon, they are invited to sign the Battle for the Net&rsquo;s letter to the FCC and to contact their member of Congress.<\/p>\n<p>While the Battle for the Net coalition&rsquo;s gripes are similar to those of the Internet Association, the Battle for the Net goes farther in pointing at a specific solution. It, along with Pelosi, asks that the FCC categorize ISPs as a &ldquo;Title II&rdquo; industry, a move that would give the agency legal jurisdiction to strictly regulate the companies that own the Internet &#8220;pipes&#8221; &mdash; or the fiber that the Internet runs on. The Internet Association, while leaving what is known as the &ldquo;Title II option&rdquo; on the table, has stopped short of actively advocating for that end.<\/p>\n<p>The debate over net neutrality is at this point intrinsically intertwined with a discussion of the Title II option, which itself hinges on a rather arcane detail in administrative law. In January, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the FCC&rsquo;s previous rules on net neutrality on the grounds that the agency does not have legal jurisdiction over ISPs since they do not fall under &ldquo;Title II&rdquo; of the regulators&rsquo; statute. Public advocacy groups, like Free Press, which organized Battle for the Net, argue that the FCC should simply fix that problem, since it&#8217;s up to the agency to decide how it categorizes different industries.<\/p>\n<p>But here&rsquo;s where the discussion really heats up. Big ISPs, like Comcast, Verizon and Time Warner Cable, as well as their trade associations, have said that the Title II option, which would allow the FCC to treat ISPs like telephone companies, would <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncta.com\/platform\/public-policy\/regulating-broadband-under-title-ii-is-not-highly-deregulatory\/\" target=\"_blank\">unleash a storm<\/a> of suffocating regulation. They say that if they are regulated &ldquo;like public utilities,&rdquo; they would have no incentive to invest hundreds of millions every year in researching and developing new technologies, much less maintaining and improving the network of pipes and wires that connect American homes to the World Wide Web.<\/p>\n<p>Advocates for the Title II option say the ISPs, which enjoy monopolies and duopolies in most American cities and towns, <em>should<\/em> be regulated strictly, but argue that categorizing ISPs under Title II would actually lead to <em>fewer<\/em> regulations. The categorization would allow the FCC to pass a simple, blanket, easy-to-enforce rule on net neutrality for all ISPs, they say, rather than going at it piecemeal. Some advocates say that by avoiding the Title II option, the FCC is wading into unnecessary red tape. The agency&#8217;s current proposed rules call for the formation of a special ombudsman office within the FCC where federal bureaucrats would manually review when web companies paid ISPs for premium service.<\/p>\n<p>The issue of net neutrality rocketed into national headlines earlier this year after Netflix accused big ISPs, like Comcast and Verizon, of deliberately slowing down streaming speeds and causing streaming videos to buffer. After Netflix paid the ISPs a fee, the download speeds increased. ISPs say such deals are only fair now that a handful of companies, like Netflix and Google&#8217;s YouTube, dominate the majority of web traffic during primetime hours.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear when exactly the debate surrounding net neutrality will end. The FCC could finalize its proposed rules on net neutrality in the next few months or, if public pressure mounts, it could be forced to return to the drawing board early next year. President Obama, who has been a vociferous advocate for net neutrality&#8211;and a critic of &#8220;fast lanes&#8221; on the Internet&#8211;has stopped short, but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/the-switch\/wp\/2014\/08\/05\/obama-strikes-a-populist-tone-on-net-neutrality\/\">just barely<\/a>, of condemning the FCC&#8217;s proposed rules.<\/p>\n<p>With rising populist anger, a raft of new PR campaigns, and Silicon Valley tech firms set to be major political campaign contributors in 2016, something&#8217;s likely to break soon.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\"

But before her 2013 filibuster&mdash;which, she tells TIME, is not even the most important filibuster she&rsquo;s staged&mdash;Davis was the daughter of a single mom and a single mom herself, experiences she has written about in her memoir <em>Forgetting to be Afraid<\/em>, released this week.<\/p>\n<p>She spoke to TIME about her struggle to get a college degree, her fight for reproductive rights, and her favorite ice cream (it&#8217;s Rocky Road).<\/p>\n<p><strong>TIME: Your memoir is called<em> Forgetting to be Afraid.<\/em> What inspired the title?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wendy Davis: It was inspired by a Lady Bird Johnson quote. She was asked at least on one occasion by a group of young women how it is that she pushed through fear to do things, because she was inherently a very shy person. She advised them that you have to get so wrapped up in something you forget to be afraid. My whole life story can be captured through that idea. I had to make a way out of no way for myself and my daughter. Due to the fact that I was so wrapped up in trying to do that, I forgot to be afraid of doing it. Along every step of my journey I think that that sentiment really captures how it is that I&rsquo;ve pushed through fear, put my head down and done what I needed to do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you inherently shy yourself?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was a very shy child. And I talk in the book about moving from being very shy to being a fighter and that shift really came from the need to fight first for myself and my daughter and then next in the public service arena for people who don&rsquo;t have the same opportunities that I had in a myriad of ways.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In your book you write about your decision to terminate two pregnancies for medical reasons. Did that motivate your filibuster against the Texas abortion bill?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Honestly my personal experience in that regard was part of what I want people to know about me in hopes that it might help people struggling with the same situation. But my stand for reproductive rights in Texas was primarily motivated by my understanding of the harm that would come to women across our state if they were denied access to safe reproductive care. I have always firmly believed that women should be trusted to make decisions for themselves with their family, their faith, their doctor, and that the government has no business intruding in that most private arena. I fought that day for women, and men who love them, whose voices had been cut out of the process. In committee hearings at the state legislature there were so many people that had signed up to speak and been told after several hours that their testimony was repetitive and they were cut off. I wanted to give voice to the people who felt like they&rsquo;d not been heard.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But those restrictions were eventually passed. In fact, restrictions on abortion have been tightened across the state.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first provision, which required that doctors have admitting privileges (to a hospital) within 30 miles of an abortion clinic was implemented right away. It immediately caused 21 of the 40 clinics in Texas to close. The second provision was set to go into effect on [Sept. 1] but a federal judge ruled the law in its entirety unconstitutional. As a consequence of that and while it&rsquo;s on appeal at the 5th circuit I know that some of those health centers are considering reopening, some are waiting to see what the 5th circuit will do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Was the filibuster your defining moment as a politician?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A lot of the people know about my filibuster last summer but as important if not more to me was my filibuster in 2011 to try to stop $5.5 billion from being cut from our public schools and try to stop a dramatic reduction in financial assistance for our students trying to go to a state university. Access to opportunity comes through education and that is my primary passion and fight. And it&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m running for governor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You have daughters aged 32 and 25. Do you feel hopeful about their future?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What I see when I look at them is the fact that their mother broke through and got a college degree created a path for them to logically follow. I think about how fortunate they are that they have the ability to do that and I think about all of the other young girls in Texas who are those first generation college students like me who don&rsquo;t have the same path available to them. It&rsquo;s that concern that motivates me most.<\/p>\n<p><strong>According to your book, your mom worked at the ice cream chain Braum&rsquo;s. I love Braum&rsquo;s! I grew up in Tulsa.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You did? Well, Texas is all about Whataburger. Oklahoma is all about Braum&rsquo;s.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But your mom worked at Braum&rsquo;s! Does this make you a traitor to Braum&#8217;s?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No, I still crave a Braum&rsquo;s hamburger every now and then for sure.<\/p>\n<p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3318582\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Living","slug":"living","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/living\/"},"tag":{"name":"Newsmaker Interview","slug":"newsmaker-interview","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/newsmaker-interview\/"},"tags":"abortion|Greg Abbott|Newsmaker|Newsmaker Interview|reproductive rights|Texas|Wendy Davis","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/wendy-davis.jpg?crop=899px%2C398px%2C2487px%2C2488px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/wendy-davis.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/wendy-davis.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/wendy-davis.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/wendy-davis.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Eric Gay\u2014AP","caption":"Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis presents her new education policy during a stop at Palo Alto College in San Antonio, Texas on Aug. 26, 2014.
