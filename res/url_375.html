            <p>As various networks and talking heads now congratulate the NFL for doing the right thing, it's worth remembering that the video of Ray Rice <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/09/08/ray-rice-elevator-knockout-fiancee-takes-crushing-punch-video/">brutally assaulting </a>his then girlfriend simply confirms the narrative that had already been reported. There was already <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/09/08/ray-rice-elevator-knockout-fiancee-takes-crushing-punch-video/">deeply disturbing video</a> of Rice dragging Janay Rice (née Palmer) out of an elevator. The complaint specifically accused Rice of committing "assault by attempting to cause bodily injury of J. Palmer, <strong>specifically by striking her with his hand, rendering her unconscious.</strong>"</p>

<p>The NFL claims that it had never seen the video before today. But the video that was already out there, along with the reporting, was bad enough. The idea that it took today's release to understand the gravity of things is insupportable. You don't become a sports and entertainment juggernaut through absent-mindedness. Likely, <a href="http://deadspin.com/the-ravens-just-deleted-that-terrible-janay-rice-tweet-1632105673">there are</a> other forces at work.</p>

<p>Back in July, Barry Petchesky <a href="http://deadspin.com/reports-ray-rice-suspended-for-two-games-for-uppercutt-1610151745">wrote the following</a> <a href="http://deadspin.com/whose-idiotic-ray-rice-comments-look-especially-awful-t-1632033541">for Deadspin</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is surveillance video, reportedly in the police's possession, that shows the blow that knocked Palmer out. One day that video will be leaked, and we'll all see Ray Rice deck a woman, and we'll remember that the NFL suspended him for two games.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--INSERT IN_ARTICLE AD--><p>That is exactly what happened. It will be very interesting to see if the NFL can make Rice's "indefinite" suspension stick. The league suspended Rice for a meager two games for knocking his wife unconscious. The league now propose to suspend him indefinitely for ... the same thing. This suspension only indirectly relates to the protecting women. It mostly relates to protecting the shield. </p>            </div><!-- river-article -->

<p>Last week I posted <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/08/acting-french/375743/">an essay</a> about my time away from the world of English, and some of the lessons I'd learned. I am incredibly grateful to Middlebury College in general, its language schools in particular, and the French school especially. I am forever indebted, personally, to <em>mes professeurs,</em> Corinne Fertein, Véronique Ogden and Simone Muller. They were not just great French teachers, they were some of the best teachers I've ever had. (The teaching quality in the French school is the subject for another day. It was superior.) I am exceedingly thankful to have been selected as a <a href="http://www.davisfellowsforpeace.org/">Kathryn Davis Fellow</a>. </p>

<p>Attending Middlebury was one of the most significant experiences of my life. It's not even so much that I never dreamed I'd go seven weeks without English. It's that<span>—</span>until very recently<span>—</span>I never even knew that this was something worth wanting. My son did a four-week version of the same program. He stayed on another campus, but his group came to visit my campus on the second week.  I can't quite explain what it is to see your child, meet all of his friends, and have this entire interaction in another language. It was surreal. </p>

<aside class="pullquote">School never ends for the hard student. She is primarily concerned with her curiosities, not the benchmarks of others.</aside><p>I'll save all the other such experiences for another post. What we have here is my "after" video. (<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/373157/learn-to-speak-french/">Here</a> is the "before.") The video can't really show the progress that was most important to me. What changed most at Middlebury, for me, was not in how I talked, but how I heard. The first time we did this video there were several moments when I didn't even understand the question. I had no such moments this time.</p>

<p>I now feel that I have a crude map of the language, even if there are many unexplored islands. On the map of things I do not know, prepositions and pronouns loom large. You can see this in the video. I make the typical anglophone mistake of using the preposition "pour" when trying to indicate time. That is because in English we use "for" a lot to express time and duration. The French use a blizzard of prepositions to do similar work, (il y a, depuis, en etc.) </p>

<p>The hardest thing about learning any new skill is that beginning portion when you are forced to walk in the dark, with no map at all. It's not just what you don't know, it's that you have no idea what you don't know and when you'll stop not knowing it. Fear then takes over. Will I ever read Rousseau? Why can't I get that "r" right? When I will I stop embarrassing myself every time I speak? Why do I keep confusing "son" and "ton?" What is wrong with me? Do I have a brain injury? The questions<span>—</span>the darkness<span>—</span>dogs us. And so we quit. It's hard to sit in ignorance<span>—</span>mostly because there are no real signs of when that ignorance will end. </p>

<p>I am privileged, in that I was born into a culture where no one had the right to be the best at anything. You had better dance at that party. No one cares that you can't cabbage patch. And you had better play basketball on that crate<span>—</span>even if you can only rebound and play D. I've sucked at a lot of things in my life. I've also gotten better at them. At 15, I was an awful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DapyrLGvuA">djembe drummer</a>. By 17,  I could both play the djembe, shave a goat-skin, attach it to the head and string the drum. I was a bad poet. I became a better one. I was a bad reporter. I became a decent one. I knew very little about the Civil War. And then I read some books, and I <a href="http://absurdbeats.net/tncs-civil-war/">knew much more</a>. It's true that I was not a scholastic high-achiever. But have always been<span>—</span>and expect to always be<span>—</span>a hard student. School never ends for the hard student. She is primarily concerned with her curiosities, not the benchmarks of others.</p>

<p>My expectations for French are derived from my experience. I expect to suck for awhile. Then I expect to slowly get better. The point is neither mastery, nor fluency. The point is hard study<span>—</span>the repeated application of a principle until the eyes and ears bleed a little. And then all of that again. In my time as a hard student, I have found that it is much better to focus on process, than outcomes. The question isn't "When will I master the subjunctive?" It's "Did I put in my hour of study today?" </p>

<p>I've gone back to some classics<span>—</span><em>English Grammar For Speakers of French</em>. I've gone back to some non-classics<span>—</span><em>X-Men: Second Coming</em> en Français. I'm going to have three hour long conversations a week. And I am going to do this because I like doing it. I like the study and discovery. Fluency<span>—</span>to the extent it exists<span>—</span>is not really up to any conscious part of me.</p>

            <p>I spent the majority of this summer at Middlebury College, studying at l’École Française. I had never been to Vermont. I have not been many places at all. I did not have an adult passport until I was 37 years old. Sometimes I regret this. And then sometimes not. Learning to travel when you’re older allows you to be young again, to touch the childlike amazement that is so often dulled away by adult things. In the past year, I have seen more of the world than at any point before, and thus, I have been filled with that juvenile feeling more times then I can count—at a train station in Strasbourg, in an old Parisian bookstore, on a wide avenue in Lawndale. It was no different in Vermont where the green mountains loomed like giants. I would stare at these mountains out of the back window of the Davis Family Library. I would watch the clouds, which, before the rain, drooped over the mountains like lampshades, and I would wonder what, precisely, I had been doing with my life.</p>

<div class="ad-unit-placeholder" data-pos="boxfeatures"> </div>

<p>I was there to improve my French. My study consisted of four hours of class work and four hours of homework. I was forbidden from reading, writing, speaking, or hearing English. I watched films in French, tried to read a story in <em>L</em><em>e Monde</em> each day, listened to RFI and a lot of Barbara and Karim Oeullet. At every meal I spoke French, and over the course of the seven weeks I felt myself gradually losing touch with the broader world. This was not a wholly unpleasant feeling. In the moments I had to speak English (calling my wife, interacting with folks in town or at the book store), my mouth felt alien and my ear slightly off.</p>

<!--INSERT IN_ARTICLE AD--><p>And there were the latest developments, the likes of which I perceived faintly through the French media. I had some vague sense that King James had done something grand, that the police were killing black men over cigarette sales, that a passenger plane had been shot out the sky, and that powerful people in the world still believed that great problems could be ultimately solved with great armaments. In sum, I knew that very little had changed. And I knew this even with my feeble French eyes, which turned the news of the world into an exercise in impressionism. Everything felt distorted. I understood that things were happening out there, but their size and scope mostly eluded me.</p>

<p>Acquiring a second language is hard. I have been told that it is easier for children, but I am not so sure if this is for reasons of biology or because adults have so much more to learn. Still, it remains true that the vast majority of students at Middlebury were younger than me, and not just younger, but fiercer. My classmates were, in the main, the kind of high-achieving college students who elect to spend their summer vacation taking on eight hours a day of schoolwork. There was no difference in work ethic between us. If I spent more time studying than my classmates, that fact should not be taken as an accolade but as a marker of my inefficiency.</p>

<aside class="pullquote instapaper_ignore"><span>The majority of people I interacted with spoke better, wrote better, read better, and heard better than me. There was no escape from my ineptitude.</span></aside><p>They had something over me, and that something was a culture, which is to say a suite of practices so ingrained as to be ritualistic. The scholastic achievers knew how to quickly memorize a poem in a language they did not understand. They knew that recopying a handout a few days before an exam helped them digest the information. They knew to bring a pencil, not a pen, to that exam. They knew that you could (with the professor’s permission) record lectures and take pictures of the blackboard.</p>

<p>This culture of scholastic achievement had not been acquired yesterday. The same set of practices had allowed my classmates to succeed in high school, and had likely been reinforced by other scholastic achievers around them. I am sure many of them had parents who were scholastic high-achievers. This is how social capital reinforces itself and compounds. It is not merely one high achieving child, but a flock of high achieving children, each backed by high-achieving parents. I once talked to a woman who spoke German, English and French and had done so since she was a child. How did this happen, I asked? “Everyone in my world spoke multiple languages,” she explained. “It was just what you did.”</p>

<figure class="full-width"><img alt="" height="1030" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/08/DSC00514/550a4db71.jpg" width="1920" style="width: 100.0% !important;max-width: 1920px !important;height: auto !important;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-box-sizing:border-box;-moz-box-sizing:border-box;"/></figure><p class="dropcap">There were five tiers of French students, starting with those who could barely speak a word and scaling upward to those who were pursuing a master’s degree. I was in the second tier, meaning I could order a coffee, recount a story with some difficulty, write a short note (sans verb and gender agreement), and generally understand a French speaker provided he or she talked to me really slowly. The majority of people I interacted with spoke better, wrote better, read better, and heard better than me. There was no escape from my ineptitude. At every waking hour, someone said something to me that I did not understand. At every waking hour, I mangled some poor Frenchman’s lovely language. For the entire summer, I lived by two words: “Désolé, encore.”</p>

<p>Compared with my classmates on the second tier, my test scores were on the lower end. Each week, in my literature class, we were responsible for the recitation of some French poems (Baudelaire, Verlaine, Lamartine) from memory, and each day we had to recite a stanza. This sort of exercise may well be familiar to readers of <em>The Atlantic</em>, but the rituals required to master it were totally new to me. I had never been a high-achieving student. Indeed, during my 15 or so years in school, I was a remarkably low-achieving student.</p>

<figcaption class="caption">The Joy of Learning French</figcaption></figure><p>There were years when I failed the majority of my classes. This was not a matter of my being better suited for the liberal arts than sciences. I was an English minor in college. I failed American Literature, British Literature, Humanities, and (voilà) French. The record of failure did not end until I quit college to become a writer. My explanation for this record is unsatisfactory: I simply never saw the point of school. I loved the long process of understanding. In school, I often felt like I was doing something else.</p>

<p>Like many black children in this country, I did not have a culture of scholastic high achievement around me. There were very few adults around me who’d been great students and were subsequently rewarded for their studiousness. The phrase “Ivy League” was an empty abstraction to me. I mostly thought of school as a place one goes so as not to be eventually killed, drugged, or jailed. These observations cannot be disconnected from the country I call home, nor from the government to which I swear fealty.</p>

<aside class="pullquote instapaper_ignore"><span>I mostly thought of school as a place one goes so as to not be eventually killed, drugged, or jailed.</span></aside><p>For most of American history, it has been national policy to plunder the capital accumulated by black people—social or otherwise. It began with the prohibition against reading, proceeded to separate and wholly unequal schools, and continues to this very day in our tacit acceptance of segregation. When building capital, it helps to know the right people. One aim of American policy, historically, has been to insure that the “right people” are rarely black. Segregation then ensures that these rare exceptions are spread thin, and that the rest of us have no access to other “right people.”</p>

<div class="ad-unit-placeholder" data-pos="boxfeatures"> </div>

<p>And so a white family born into the lower middle class can expect to live around a critical mass of people who are more affluent or worldly and thus see other things, be exposed to other practices and other cultures. A black family with a middle class salary can expect to live around a critical mass of poor people, and mostly see the same things they (and the poor people around them) are working hard to escape. This too compounds.</p><div class="pagebreak"></div>

<p>Now, in America, invocations of culture are mostly an exercise in awarding power an air of legitimacy. You can see this in <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/21/remarks-president-my-brothers-keeper-town-hall">the recent remarks by the president</a>, where he turned a question about preserving Native American culture into a lecture on how we (blacks and Native Americans) should be more like the Jews and Asian Americans, who refrain from criticizing the intellectuals in their midst of “acting white.” The entire charge rests on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/07/24/what-president-obama-gets-wrong-about-acting-white/">shaky</a> <a href="http://asr.sagepub.com/content/70/4/582.abstract">social science</a> and the obliteration of history. When Asian Americans and Jewish Americans—on American soil—endure the full brunt of white supremacist assault, perhaps a comparison might be in order.</p>

<p>But probably not. That is because fences are an essential element of human communities. The people who patrol these fences are generally unkind to those they find in violation. The phrase “getting above your raising” is little more than anxious working-class border patrolling. The term “white trash” is little more than anxious ruling-class border patrolling. I am neither an expert in the culture of Jewish Americans nor Asian Americans, but I would be shocked if they too were immune. Some years ago I profiled the rapper Jin. As the first Asian-American rapper to secure a major label contract, he often found himself enduring racist cracks from black rappers abroad and the prodding of fence-patrollers at home. “’Yo, what is this? You really think you’re black, Jin?” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/21/magazine/21JIN.html?pagewanted=all&amp;position=">he recalled his parents saying</a>. “Bottom line—you’re not black, Jin.’”</p>

<p>Pretending that black people are unique—or more ardent—in their fence-patrolling, and thus more parochial and anti-intellectual, serves to justify the current uses of American power. The American citizen is free to say, “Look at them, they criticize each other <em>for reading</em>!” and then go about his business. In that sense it is little different than raising the myth of “black on black crime” <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/08/black-people-are-not-ignoring-black-on-black-crime/378629/">when asked about Ferguson</a>.</p>

<figure class="full-width"><img alt="" height="2014" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/08/DSC00511/8c2b50fef.jpg" width="3611" style="width: 100.0% !important;max-width: 3611px !important;height: auto !important;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-box-sizing:border-box;-moz-box-sizing:border-box;"/></figure><p class="dropcap">I will confess to having very little experience with fence-patrolling, and virtually none with the idea that if you are holding a book, you are “acting white.” The Baltimore of my youth was a place where white people rarely ventured. It would not have occurred to anyone I knew to associate reading with white people because very few of us knew any. And I read everything I could find: <em>A Wrinkle In Time, David Walker’s Appeal, Dragon’s of Autumn Twilight, Seize The Time, Deadly Bugs and Killer Insects, The Web of Spider-Man.</em> I had a full set of Childcraft. I loved the volume <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Make-Childcraft-The-How-Library/dp/B000EACIIS"><em>Make and Do</em></a>. I had a full set of World Book encyclopedias. I used to pick up the fat “P” edition, flip to a random page, and read for hours. When I was just 6 years old, my mother took me to the Enoch Pratt Free Library on Garrison Boulevard and enrolled me in a competition to see which child could read the most books. I read 24 that summer, far outdistancing the competition. My mother smiled. The librarian gave me candy. I was very proud.</p>

<p>For carrying books in black neighborhoods, in black schools, around black people, I was called many things—nerd, bright, doofus, Malcolm, Farrakhan, Mandela, sharp, smart, airhead. I was told that my “head was too far in the clouds.” I was told that I was “going to do something one day.” But I was never called white. The people who called me a nerd were black. The people who said I was going to “do something one day” were also black. There was no one else around me, and no one else in America then cared. This was not just true of me, it was true of most black children of that era who were then, and are now, the most segregated group in this country. Segregation meant many of us had to rely on traditions closer to home.</p>

<aside class="pullquote instapaper_ignore">The people who called me a nerd were black. The people who said I was going to “do something one day” were also black.</aside><p>And at home I found a separate culture of intellectual achievement. This is the tradition of Carter G. Woodson, Frederick Douglass, and Malcolm X. It argues for education not simply as credentialism or certification, but as a profound act of auto-liberation. This was the culture of my childhood and it gave me some of the greatest thrills of my youth.</p>

<div class="ad-unit-placeholder" data-pos="boxfeatures"> </div>

<p>I was a boy haunted by questions: Why do the lilies close at night? Why does my father always say, “I can dig it"? And who really killed the dinosaurs? And why is my life so unlike everything I see on TV? That feeling—the not knowing, the longing for knowing, and the eventual answer—is love and youth to me. And I have always preferred libraries to classrooms because the wide open library is the ultimate venue for this theater. This culture was reinforced by my parents, and the politically conscious parents around me, and their politically conscious children. The culture was so strong that it could be regarded as a kind of social capital. It was so old that it could also be regarded as a legacy. This legacy is more responsible for my presence in these august pages than any other. That is because a good writer must ultimately be an autodidact and take a dim view of credentials. My culture failed to make me into a high-achieving student. It succeeded at making me into a writer.</p>

<p>I have never had much of an urge to brag about this. I have always known that in failing to become a scholastic achiever, I forfeited knowledge of certain things. (A <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2012/12/my-heroes-your-stamps/266672/">mastery of Augustine</a> comes to mind.) But what I did not understand was that I had also forfeited a culture, which is to say a tool kit, a set of pins and tumblers that might have unlocked the language which I so presently adore.</p>

<p>Scholastic achievement is sometimes demeaned as the useless memorization of facts. I suspect that it has more to offer than this. If you woke my French literature professor at 2 a.m., she could recite the deuxième strophe of Verlaine’s “Il Pleure Dans Mon Coeur.” I suspect this memorization, this holding of the work in her head, allowed her to analyze it and turn it over in ways I could only do with the text in front of me. More directly, there is no real way for an adult to learn French without some amount of memorization. French is a language that obeys its rules when it feels like it. There is no unwavering rule to tell you which nouns are masculine, or which verbs require a preposition. Memory is the only way through.</p>

<figure class="full-width"><img alt="" height="2046" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/08/DSC00504/a465fd037.jpg" width="4610" style="width: 100.0% !important;max-width: 4610px !important;height: auto !important;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-box-sizing:border-box;-moz-box-sizing:border-box;"/></figure><p class="dropcap">At Middlebury, I spent as much time as I could with the master’s students, hovering right at the edge of overbearing. On average, I understood 30 percent of what was being said. This was, of course, the point. I wanted to be reminded of who I was. I wanted to be young again, to feel that old thrill of not knowing. It is the same feeling I had as a boy, wondering about the lilies and dinosaurs, listening to “The Bridge Is Over,” wondering where in the world was Queens.</p><div class="pagebreak"></div>

<p>And I was ignorant. I felt as if someone had carried me off at night, taken me out to sea, and set me adrift in a life-raft. And the night was beautiful because it held all the things I would never know, and in that I saw my doom—the time when I could learn no more. Morning, noon, and evening, I sat on the terrace listening to the young master’s students talk. They would recount their days, share their jokes, or pass on their complaints. They came from everywhere—San Francisco, Atlanta, Seattle, Boulder, Hackensack, Philadelphia, Kiev. And they loved all the things I so wanted to love, but had not made time to love—Baudelaire, Balzac, Rimbaud. I would listen and feel the night folding around me, and the ice-water of youth surging through me.</p>

<div class="ad-unit-placeholder" data-pos="leaderbottomfeatures"> </div>

<p>One afternoon, I was walking from lunch feeling battered by the language. I started talking with a young master in training. I told her I was having a tough time. She gave me some encouraging words in French from a famous author. I told her I didn’t understand. She repeated them. I still didn’t understand. She repeated them again. I shook my head, smiled, and walked away mildly frustrated because I understood every word she was saying but could not understand how it fit. It was as though someone had said, “He her walks swim plus that yesterday the fight.” (This is how French often sounds to me.)</p>

<p>The next day, I sat at lunch with her and another young woman. I asked her to spell the quote out for me. I wrote the phrase down. I did not understand. The other young lady explained the function of the pronouns in the sentence. Suddenly I understood—and not just the meaning of the phrase. I understood something about the function of language, why being able to diagram sentences was important, why understanding partitives and collective nouns was important.</p>

<p>In my long voyage through this sea of language, that was my first sighting of land. I now knew how much I didn’t know. The feeling of discovery and understanding that came from this was incredible. It was the first moment when I thought I might survive the sea.</p>

<figure class="full-width"><img alt="" height="1581" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/08/DSC00510/e2c740627.jpg" width="2886" style="width: 100.0% !important;max-width: 2886px !important;height: auto !important;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-box-sizing:border-box;-moz-box-sizing:border-box;"/></figure><p class="dropcap">My personal road to this great feeling, to these discoveries, to Middlebury, was not the normal one. I was raised among people skeptical of a canon that had long been skeptical of them. I needed some independent sense of myself, of my cultures and traditions, before I could take a mature look at the West. I wanted nothing to do with Locke because I knew that he wanted little to do with me. I saw no reason to learn French because it was the language of the plunderers of Haiti.</p>

<div class="ad-unit-placeholder" data-pos="boxfeatures"> </div>

<p>I had to be a nationalist before I could be a humanist. I had to come to understand that black people are not merely the victims of the West, but its architects. The philosophes started the sentence and Martin Luther King finished it. The greatest renditions of this country’s greatest anthems are all sung by black people—Ray, Marvin, Whitney. That is neither biology nor a mistake. It is the necessary cosmopolitanism of a people, viewing America from the basement and thus forced to take their lessons when they get them—absorbing, reinterpreting, refining, creating.</p>

<p>Now it must never be concluded that an urge toward the cosmopolitan, toward true education, will make people stop hitting you. The inverse is more likely. In the early 19th century, the Cherokee Nation was told by the new Americans that if its members adopted their “civilized” ways, they would soon be respected as equals. This promise was deeply embedded in the early 19th century approach to this continents indigenous nations.</p>

<p>“We will never do an unjust act towards you. on the contrary we wish you to live in peace, to increase in numbers, to learn to labor, as we do,” <a href="http://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/founders/default.xqy?keys=FOEA-chron-1800-1809-01-10-13">Thomas Jefferson said</a>. “I<span style="line-height: 1.6;">n time you will be as we are; you will become one people with us; your blood will mix with ours; &amp; will spread, with ours, over this great Island. Hold fast then, my Children, the Chain of friendship, which binds us together; &amp; join us in keeping it forever bright &amp; unbroken.”</span></p>

<p>The Cherokee Nation—likely for their own reasons—embraced mission schools. Some of them converted to Christianity. Other intermarried. Others still enslaved blacks. They adopted a written Constitution, created a script for their language and published a newspaper, <em>The Cherokee Phoenix,</em> in English and Cherokee. Thus the Native Americans of that time showed themselves to be as able to to integrate elements of the West with their own culture as any group of Asian or Jewish American. But the wolf has never much cared whether the sheep were cultured or not.</p>

<p>“The problem, from a white point of view,” <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=0XIvPDF9ijcC&amp;lpg=PA414&amp;ots=0g2CgkTW0P&amp;dq=%22Away%20up%20yonder%20in%20the%20Cherokee%20nation.%22%20walker&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">writes historian Daniel Walker Howe</a>, “was that the success of these efforts to ’civilize the Indians’ had not yielded the expected dividend in land sales. On the contrary, the more literate, prosperous, and politically organized the Cherokees made themselves, the more resolved they became to keep what remained of their land and improve it for their own benefit.”</p>

<p>Cosmopolitanism, openness to other cultures, openness to education did not make the Cherokee pliant to American power; it gave them tools to resist. Realizing this, the United States dropped the veneer of “culture” and “civilization” and resorted to “Indian Removal,” or The Trail of Tears. The plunder was celebrated in a popular song:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All I want in this creation<br/>
Is a pretty little wife and a big plantation<br/>
Away up yonder in the Cherokee nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Native Americans of this period found that America’s talk of trading culture for rights was just a cover. In our time, it is common to urge young black children toward education so that they may be respectable or impress the “right people.” But the “right people” <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-america/education/african-americans-with-college-degrees-are-twice-as-likely-to-be-unemployed-as-other-graduates-20140527" target="_blank">remain unimpressed</a>, and the credentials of black people, in a country rooted in white supremacy, must necessarily be less. That great powers are in the business of using "respectability" and "education" to ignore these discomfiting facts does not close the book. You can never fully know. But you can walk in the right direction.</p>

<p>The citizen is lost in the labyrinth constructed by his country, when in fact straight is the gate, and narrow must always be the way. When I left for Middlebury, I had just published <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/">an article arguing for reparations</a>. People would often ask me what change I expected to come from it. But change had already come. I had gone further down the unending path of knowing, deeper into the night. I was rejecting mental enslavement. I was rejecting the lie.</p>

<p>I came to Middlebury in the spirit of the autodidactic, of auto-liberation, of writing, of Douglass and Malcolm X. I came in ignorance, and found I was more ignorant than I knew. Even there, I was much more comfortable in the library, thumbing through random histories in French, than I was in the classroom. It was not enough. It will not be enough. Sometimes you do need the master’s tools to dismantle his house.</p>            </div><!-- river-article -->

                    <p>This September we're going to revive the old book group. But instead of looking at the Civil War and Reconstruction, we're going to look at mass incarceration. There's no better book to start with on that project than Michelle Alexander's <a href="http://newjimcrow.com/">The New Jim Crow</a>. Here is a rough schedule. We can discuss below whether this works for people. Our moderator, Kathleen, will be leading the discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday, September 17: </strong><br/>
Introduction and Chapter 1 (history of racialized social control in the United States)</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday, September 24: </strong><br/>
Chapter 2 (structure of mass incarceration) and Chapter 3 (role of race in the U.S. criminal justice system)</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday, October 1: </strong><br/>
Chapter 4 (what happens once people are released from prison) and Chapter 5 (parallels between mass incarceration and Jim Crow)</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday, October 8: </strong><br/>
Chapter 6 (what acknowledging the presence of the New Jim Crow means for the future of civil rights advocacy)</p>            </div><!-- river-article -->

            <p><em>The New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/us/michael-brown-spent-last-weeks-grappling-with-lifes-mysteries.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=HpSumSmallMedia&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=photo-spot&amp;WT.nav=photo-spot&amp;_r=0">a feature</a> today looking at the brief life of Michael Brown, informing us that he was "no angel." The reasons for this are many. Brown smoked marijuana. He lived in a community that "had rough patches." He wrote rap songs that were "by turns contemplative and vulgar." He shoplifted and pushed a store clerk who tried to stop him. These details certainly paint a portrait of a young man who failed to be angelic. That is because no person is angelic—least of all teenagers—and there is very little in this piece that distinguishes Brown from any other kid his age.</p>

<p>What horrifies a lot of us beholding the spectacle of Ferguson, beholding the spectacle of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/on-the-killing-of-trayvon-martin-by-george-zimmerman/277773/">Sanford</a>, of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/02/black-boy-interrupted/283881/">Jacksonville</a>, is how easily we could see ourselves in these kids. I shudder to think of my reaction, at 17, to some strange dude following me through my own housing development. I shudder to think of my reaction, at 17, to some other strange dude pulling up next to me and telling me to turn down my music.</p>

<!--INSERT IN_ARTICLE AD--><p>And if Michael Brown was not angelic, I was practically demonic. I had my first drink when I was 11. I once brawled in the cafeteria after getting hit in the head with a steel trash can. In my junior year I failed five out of seven classes. By the time I graduated from high school, I had been arrested for assaulting a teacher and been kicked out of school (twice.) And yet no one who knew me thought I had the least bit of thug in me. That is because I also read a lot of books, loved my Commodore 64, and ghostwrote love notes for my friends. In other words, I was a human being. A large number of American teenagers live exactly like Michael Brown. Very few of them are shot in the head and left to bake on the pavement.</p>

<p>The "angelic" standard was not one created by the reporter. It was created by a society that cannot face itself, and thus must employ a dubious "morality" to hide its sins. It is reinforced by people who have embraced the notion of "twice as good" while avoiding the circumstances which gave that notion birth. Consider how easily living in a community "with rough patches" becomes part of a list of ostensible sins. Consider how easily "black-on-black crime" becomes not a marker of a shameful legacy of segregation but a moral failing.</p>

I lost track of time, so I didn't get to talk as much about housing as I wanted. But the most of the basics of the case are there. I want to thank the City Club for having me out, and hosting my very first talk on reparations. There will be a lot more of these over the next year. Hope you enjoy.</p>

            <p>A few weeks ago I received an anxious text from my wife informing me that a group of young men were fighting outside of our apartment building. We've spent most of our adult lives in New York, and most of that time in New York living in Harlem. I love Harlem for the same reason I love all the hoods I have lived in. I walk outside in my same uniform, which is to say my same jeans, my same fitted, my same hoodie, and feel myself washing away, disappearing into the boulevard, into the black and (presently) the brown, and becoming human.</p>

<p>There have been young people fighting outside my window for as long as I can remember. I was no older than five sitting on the steps of my parents' home on Woodbrook Avenue watching the older boys knock shoulders in the street—"bucking" as we called it then—daring each other to fire off. From that point on I knew that among my people fisticuffs had their own ritual and script. The script was in effect that evening: show cause (<em>some niggas jumped me in the park</em>), mouth off (<em>I ain't no punk</em>), escalate (<em>wait right her son, I'm bout to get my shit</em>). </p>

<!--INSERT IN_ARTICLE AD--><p>My wife wanted to know what she should do. She was not worried about her own safety—boys like this are primarily a threat to each other. What my wife wanted was someone who could save them young men from themselves, some power which would disperse the boys in a fashion that would not escalate things. No such power exists. I told my wife to stay inside and do nothing. I did not tell her to call the police. If you have watched the events of this past week, you may have some idea why. </p>

<p>Among the many relevant facts for any African-American negotiating their relationship with the police the following stands out: The police departments of America are endowed by the state with dominion over your body. This summer in Ferguson and Staten Island we have seen that dominion employed to the maximum ends—destruction of the body. This is neither new nor extraordinary. It does not matter if the destruction of your body <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Amadou_Diallo">was an overreaction</a>. It does not matter if the destruction of your body resulted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bell_shooting_incident">from a misunderstanding</a>. It does not matter if the destruction of your body springs from foolish policy. Sell cigarettes without proper authority and your body can be destroyed. Resent the people trying to entrap your body <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Dorismond">and it can be be destroyed</a>. Protect the home of your mother<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-city-reaches-2m-settlement-shooting-unarmed-brooklyn-man-article-1.1865665"> and your body can be destroyed</a>. Visit the home of your young daughter <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0106.coates.html">and your body will be destroyed</a>. The destroyers of your body will rarely be held accountable. Mostly they will receive pensions. </p>

<p>It will not do to point out the rarity of the destruction of your body by the people whom you pay to protect it. As Gene Demby has noted, destruction is merely the superlative form of a dominion whose prerogatives include friskings, detainings, beatings, and humiliations. All of this is common to black people. All of this is old for black people. No one is held accountable. The body of Michael Brown was left in the middle of the street for four hours. It can not be expected that anyone will be held accountable.</p>

<p>We are being told that Michael Brown attacked an armed man and tried to take his gun. The people who are telling us this hail from that universe where choke-holds are warm-fuzzies, where boys discard their skittles yelling, "You're gonna die tonight," and possess the power to summon and banish shotguns from the ether. These are the necessary myths of our country, and without them we are subject to the awful specter of history, and that is just too much for us to bear.</p>

<p>James Poulos is trying admirably to get at this, noting that we fear Lincoln's awesome prophecy. But even Poulos <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/15/the-real-nightmare-of-ferguson.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thedailybeast%2Farticles+%28The+Daily+Beast+-+Latest+Articles%29">can't quite escape</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know that America is exceptional in one key respect—we came to democracy without much bloodshed. Around the world, from Hungary and Russia to Iraq and Nigeria, we see the dream of peaceful democratization dragged again and again to what the philosopher Hegel called the slaughter-bench of history. Racial strife and murderous governments, not liberty and democracy, are the rule in history, the established pattern. We know that, mercifully, democratization scourged us only once in ferociously modern style: during the Civil War.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last sentence here nullifies the first. Some 600,000 Americans—2.5 percent of the American population—died in the Civil War. What came before this was a long bloody war—enslavement—against black families, black communities and black bodies. What came after was a terrorist regime which ruled an entire swath of this country by fire and rope. That regime was not overthrown until an era well within the living memory of many Americans. Taken all together, the body count that led us to our present tenuous democratic moment does not elevate us above the community of nations, but installs us uncomfortably within its ranks. And that is terrifying because it shows us to be neither providential nor exceptional, and only special in the subjective sense that our families are special—because they are ours.</p>

<p>My family lives in Harlem. My wife did not call the police. An older head told the angry boys that they needed to take it somewhere else, which they did. Black people are not above calling the police—but often we do so fully understanding that we are introducing an element that is unaccountable to us. We introduce the police into our communities, the way you might introduce a predator into the food chain. This is not the singular, special fault of the police. The police are but the tip of the sword wielded by American society itself. Something bigger than Stand Your Ground, the drug war, mass incarceration or any other policy is haunting us. And as long we cower from it, the events of this week are as certain as math. The question is not "if," but "when."</p>

In the meantime, one idea creeping into the discourse—that black people are unmoved by intra-community violence—deserves to be immediately dismissed.  Eugene Robinson, reacting to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/manhunt-continues-in-weekend-slaying-of-3-year-old-knijah-bibb/2014/08/12/8bd1fece-223b-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html">the tragic murder of Knijah Bibb</a>, offers <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/eugene-robinson-our-selective-outrage/2014/08/14/22a72dba-23e5-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html">an incarnation here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been through this so many times. Brown, from all reports, was a good kid who had just graduated from high school and was about to enroll in college. But young black men are automatically assumed to be dangerous thugs—and are not given the benefit of the doubt that young white men are accorded. This is racist and wrong, and it must change.</p>

<p>But we should be just as outraged over Knijah’s death—and just as determined that this kind of killing should never happen again.</p>

<p>The entire Prince George’s County police force—not just the homicide division—has been working long hours to try to find Wallace and is motivated by what a police spokesman called a “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/manhunt-continues-in-weekend-slaying-of-3-year-old-knijah-bibb/2014/08/12/8bd1fece-223b-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html" title="www.washingtonpost.com">sense of moral outrage</a>.”</p>

<p>That feeling should be universal. The near-constant background noise of black-on-black violence is too often ignored. Yet it continues to claim victims at a rate that our society should consider outrageous and unacceptable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a number of things wrong here. To the extent that killings by the police generate more outrage, it is completely understandable. Police in America are granted wide range of powers by the state including lethal force. With that power comes a special place of honor. When cops are killed the outrage is always different than when citizens are killed. Likewise when cops kill under questionable terms, more scrutiny follows directly from the logic of citizenship. Great power. Great responsibility.</p>

<p>More importantly Robinson's claim is demonstrably false. The notion that violence within the black community is "background noise" is not supported by <a href="http://newsone.com/2025185/louis-farrakhan-2012/">the historical</a> <a href="http://blacklikemoi.com/2012/09/al-sharpton-starts-occupy-the-corner-to-combat-inner-city-violence/">record</a><span>—</span><a href="http://breakingbrown.com/2014/03/black-pastors-say-not-enough-black-criminals-being-sentenced-to-the-death-penalty/">or</a> <a href="http://www.charlestonchronicle.net/82106/2152/youthled-march-against-violence-puts-community-on-notice">by</a> <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2014/01/21/anti-violence-campaign-targets-black-on-black-crime-/4695089/">Google</a>. I have <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/04/why-dont-black-people-protest-black-on-black-violence/255329/">said this before</a>. It's almost as if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_the_Violence_Movement">Stop The Violence</a> never happened, or <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interrupters">The Interruptors</a></em> never happened, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM6seEs7wgs">Kendrick Lamar</a> never happened. The call <a href="http://youtu.be/X1jeyhgUt4c">issued by Erica Ford</a> at the end of this <em>Do The Right Thing</em> retrospective is so common as to be ritual. It is not "black on black crime" that is background noise in America, but the pleas of black people.</p>

<!--INSERT IN_ARTICLE AD--><p>There is a pattern here, but it isn't the one Eugene Robinson (for whom I have a great respect) thinks. The pattern is the transmutation of black protest into moral hectoring of black people. Don Imus profanely insults a group of black women. But the real problem is gangsta rap. Trayvon Martin is killed. This becomes a conversation about how black men are bad fathers. Jonathan Martin is bullied mercilessly. This proves that black people have <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/03/politics-and-the-african-american-human-language/284228/">an unfortunate sense of irony</a>.</p>

<p>The politics of respectability are, at their root, the politics of changing the subject<span>—</span>the last resort for those who can not bear the agony of looking their country in the eye. The policy of America has been, for most of its history, white supremacy. The high rates of violence in black neighborhoods do not exist outside of these facts<span>—</span>they evidence them.</p>

<p>This history presents us with a suite of hard choices. We do not like hard choices. Here's a better idea: Let's all get together and talk about how Mike Brown would still be alive if Beyoncé would make more wholesome music, followed by a national forum on how the charge of "acting white" contributes to mass incarceration. We can conclude with a keynote lecture on "Kids Today" and a shrug.</p>            </div><!-- river-article -->

                    </div>
            <p>In "<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/">The Case for Reparations</a>," I tried to move the lens away from the enslaved and focus on their descendants. Narratively, I thought it made a much more compelling read and I it got us past the "but they're all long-dead" argument. Also, once you understand enslavement as central<span>—</span>not ancillary<span>—</span>to American history, you can then easily intuit that it would have some serious effects on policy 100 years later. When you then consider what directly followed enslavement<span>—</span>disenfranchisement, pogroms, land theft, terrorism, the entire suite of plunder<span>—</span>it seems inconceivable that 20th-century domestic policy would not be awash in white supremacy.</p>

<p>On some vague level, I understood this to be true. Some years ago (before I came here) I read Kenneth Jackson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crabgrass-Frontier-Suburbanization-United-States/dp/0195049837"><em>Crabgrass Frontier</em></a>. No one who wants to understand the shape of America's cities and suburbs can afford to skip this book. I would go so far as to say that you can't really talk intelligently about urban policy without grappling with Jackson's work. <em>Crabgrass</em> is ostensibly a history of the suburbs in America, but it ranges from antiquity to the 20th century and puts the American obsession with a front lawn and detached housing in context. That makes for great reading, and then, about halfway through the book, the bombshells start dropping. In painstaking detail, Jackson shows how the Federal Housing Administration and the Home Owners' Loan Corporation subsidized segregation, and helped author the wealth gap. I'd heard the term redlining before, but Jackson's book really laid out, in detail, how federal policy worked.</p>

<p>I thought of Jackson's book years later when I picked up Isabel Wilkerson;s<em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Warmth-Other-Suns-Americas-Migration/dp/0679763880/ref=la_B003ZHR5BW_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403799270&amp;sr=1-1">The Warmth of Other Suns</a></em>. Where Jackson outlines the racist policies of federal, local, and state government toward American cities, Wilkerson's work (among other things) tells us how black people responded to those policies. More importantly, for my work, she reversed a popular trend to conflate impoverishment with racism, and pretend as though "the black poor" are the "real" problem. If only quietly, Wilkerson builds a strong case that the policy of the American government has not been to encourage a black middle class, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/01/the-american-case-against-a-black-middle-class/267385/">but to discourage it and open it for plunder</a>.</p>

<p>Chicago is one of three cities that feature prominently in <em>Warmth</em>. Having had some experience reporting in the city, I began to consider focusing there. The other candidate was Detroit. I wish I could have gotten both. I did a mini deep-dive on Detroit history some years ago, and I strongly suspect that a long, beautiful magazine story about history and could be written from there, if some journalist would take up the challenge. I tried some years ago and failed. (You can read my attempt <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/03/detroit-was-like-cheers-everyone-knew-your-name/72226/">here</a>.) Two important books featured prominently in that attempt<span>—</span>Robert Conot's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Odyssey-Robert-E-Conot/dp/0814318061/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403799485&amp;sr=1-8&amp;keywords=american+odyssey"><em>American Odyssey</em></a> and Thomas Sugrue's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Origins-Urban-Crisis-Inequality-Princeton/dp/0691162557/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403799515&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=thomas+sugrue"><em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis</em></a>.</p>

</ul><hr/></aside><!-- END "MORE ON" LIST BOX v. 3 --><p>Conot's book has been forgotten, and I don't really know why. It's a long, deeply readable, history of Detroit from its earliest origins. In my research, I did not encounter a better one volume history of the city. It shows how examining Detroit's "crisis" as though it began in the 1960s is a mistake. Sugrue's book is more recent and has fared a lot better. It localizes much of what Kenneth Jackson discusses and<span>—</span>again<span>—</span>shows just the degree to which racist violence shaped the Detroit we know today.</p>

<p>I decided to focus on Chicago after reading Arnold Hirsch's essential, if dense, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Second-Ghetto-1940-1960-Historical/dp/0226342441/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403799679&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=making+the+second+ghetto"><em>Making the Second Ghetto</em></a>. Hirsch's book can be read in conjunction with Sugrue's, though Sugrue is less in the weeds and more readable. But again, if you want to understand modern Chicago, you can't do without Hirsch's work. Every time I hear someone speak about "black on black crime" in Chicago, I want hurl a hardcover of <em>Making The Second Ghetto</em> at them. </p>

<p>The "Making" part is important and here is when the core of my reparations argument began to form (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ghetto-building does not make for an edifying tale.<strong> To speak of agency and policy is, ultimately to speak of responsibility.</strong> The 'Second Ghetto' did not just happen. It was willed into existence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an aside, in each of these books, I thought I saw the dim outline of  an argument for reparations. It was as though the authors were going right up to the edge, and saying "Won't someone rid America of its troublesome amnesia." </p>

<p>Having decided to focus on Chicago I went to Beryl Satter's history of contract lending in the city, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Family-Properties-Struggle-Transformed-Chicago/dp/0805091424/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403800102&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=beryl+satter+family+properties"><em>Family Properties</em></a>. <em>The Warmth of Other Suns</em> is the mother of "The Case for Reparations." <em>Family Properties</em> is the father. No two books were more important to me in my research. Satter's book is many things at once. It is a history of housing. It is an analysis of relationships between black and Jewish communities. And it is a family memoir (her dad was both a housing activist and a landlord.) But most importantly it is an account of how federal policy was used to fleece people<span>—</span>many of whom are still living. It was in Satter's book that I first came across the name Clyde Ross. There's some lovely karma in this, because Ross was profiled in the pages of this magazine in 1972. But I didn't even know about the 1972 article<span>—</span>nor did my editors<span>—</span>until I read about it in <em>Family Properties</em>.</p><div class="pagebreak"></div>

<!--INSERT IN_ARTICLE AD--><p>What I saw in all of these books that was so damning was intent. Government policy toward African-Americans is not an argument for the ineffectuality of government, on the contrary it is an argument for just how effective government can be. The intent of mid-20th-century policy was the elevation of a white middle class and the preservation of white supremacy. The policy was a rousing success. That became apparent reading some of the "place-based" sociology evidence. Patrick Sharkey's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stuck-Place-Neighborhoods-Progress-Equality/dp/0226924254/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403800675&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=stuck+in+place"><em>Stuck in Place</em></a>, Robert Sampson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-American-City-Enduring-Neighborhood/dp/022605568X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403800712&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=robert+sampson"><em>Great American City</em></a>, and Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Apartheid-Segregation-Making-Underclass/dp/0674018214/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403800737&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=american+apartheid"><em>American Apartheid</em></a>. I recommend reading these three together. Massey and Denton's book gives you the national numbers on segregation and its effects on black people. Sharkey's book shows how those numbers have not changed since the early '70s and how they are perpetuated in black neighborhoods. Sampson's book focuses, with laser-precision, on those effects in Chicago.</p>

<p>Each of these books are indebted, somehow, to the work of the great sociologist and public intellectual William Julius Wilson. But there is a shift in each of these. Massey and Denton are directly in debate with Wilson<span>—</span>they believe Wilson downplays segregation. Sharkey and Sampson (I suspect) see themselves building on Wilson's neighborhood focus. But their work is also in conflict with the view that the black impoverished class is the "truly disadvantaged." Certainly they are "more" disadvantaged groups, but racist policy continues to be a grievous injury. If I were going to start again I would go like this:</p>

<p>1.) <strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crabgrass-Frontier-Suburbanization-United-States/dp/0195049837">Crabgrass Frontier</a></em>, by Kenneth Jackson</strong><br/>
This gets us grounded and immediately dispenses with the popular notion that our cities and suburbs were unplanned. I can not stress how necessary this book is.</p>

<p>2.) <strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Warmth-Other-Suns-Migration/dp/0679763880">The Warmth of Other Suns</a></em>, by Isabel Wilkerson</strong><br/>
I would read this to get a more intimate history in the mix early. It's very important to remember that beneath all of this are the lives of individual Americans. <em>Warmth</em> is the finest piece of journalism I've read on America in a very long time.</p>

<p>3.) <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Origins-Urban-Crisis-Inequality/dp/0691121869"><em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis</em></a>, by Thomas Sugrue</strong><br/>
This picks up on a lot of the research in <em>Crabgrass</em> around redlining, but zooms in on Detroit. It also adds another feature: pervasive white violence. The thing to understand about racist "policy" is that it existed in consort with racist private policy, racist civic groups, and racist people.</p>

<p>4.) <strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Second-Ghetto-1940-1960-Historical/dp/0226342441">Making the Second Ghetto</a></em>, by Arnold Hirsch</strong><br/>
A tough read, but an essential, granular analysis of how Chicago's ghettos were "made."</p>

<p>5.) <strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Family-Properties-Struggle-Transformed-Chicago/dp/0805091424">Family Properties</a></em>, by Beryl Satter</strong><br/>
The perfect compliment to Hirsch. Satter's book breathes more, and connects all of that policy to actual people in North Lawndale. More disturbing: Satter shows that public policy made private plunder possible. </p>

<p>6.) <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Apartheid-Segregation-Making-Underclass/dp/0674018214"><em>American Apartheid</em></a>, by Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton</strong><br/>
In a sense, a compilation of the effects of everything you will have read up to this point. Massey and Denton demonstrate that African-Americans are not just another "ethnicity" on the come up, but the most hyper-segregated group in American history.</p>

<p>7.) <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-American-City-Enduring-Neighborhood/dp/0226734560"><em>Great American City</em></a>, by Robert Sampson</strong><br/>
Back to Chicago, one last time. Again, a book about effects. Sampson is no longer in the realm of history. His data is very recent and very depressing.</p>

<p>8.) <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stuck-Place-Neighborhoods-Progress-Equality/dp/0226924254"><em>Stuck In Place</em></a>, by Patrick Sharkey</strong><br/>
By this point, you will likely be thoroughly bummed out. I was. Sharkey finishes us off by critiquing the "progress" made after the Civil Rights movement. Again, we see the enduring and pervasive effects of segregation. A bracing and important read.</p><p>

            <p>About five years ago, I began a deep dive into the Civil War, most of it <a href="http://absurdbeats.net/tncs-civil-war/">chronicled here</a>. That dive culminated in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/02/why-do-so-few-blacks-study-the-civil-war/308831/">an essay in our commemorative Civil War issue</a>, much like my deep dive on housing and "colorless" policy culminated in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/">The Case for Reparations</a>. The earlier piece built toward the later one. The Civil War revealed to me the price, and the bounty, of enslavement in this country. The things I focus on in the reparations piece—housing and 20th-century policy—all spring from that period<strong> </strong>of American history. I could not have understood 20th-century discrimination without understanding its 19th-century manifestations. My entry into this period<strong> </strong>was idiosyncratic and the reading list below reflects that. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations-a-narrative-bibliography/372000/">Again</a>, nothing here is definitive. I can only show you the path I walked.</p>

<p>Before I took the dive into the Civil War, I understood the enslavement as a moral catastrophe. I also had some vague sense that that enslavement had helped shepherd America into being. Finally I knew that the Civil War was somehow related to slavery. All three of these notions ultimately had to be revised. That enslavement in America was somehow more than a moral problem became apparent while reading the grandfather of all Civil War histories, James McPherson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Battle-Cry-Freedom-Oxford-History/dp/019516895X"><em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em></a>.<em> Battle Cry</em> is ostensibly a history of The Late Unpleasantness, but it is also an expression of the centrality of enslavement in American history.</p>

<!--INSERT IN_ARTICLE AD--><p>The first 200 pages or so show that the War was about not only the perpetuation of "African slavery," but its expansion. McPherson quotes directly from the mouths of secessionists who have no problem laying out bondage as their primary casus belli. McPherson shows the essential place enslavement held in the economy of the South and in America at large. Thus the conflagration that follows does not appear out of thin air. Thus when McPherson begins detailing double-timing and flanking maneuvers you have some sense that you are doing something more than watching people play out a violent football game.</p>

<hr/></aside><!-- END "MORE ON" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --><p>Conservatively speaking, 600,000 soldiers lost their lives in the Civil War, two percent of the American population at the time. Twenty percent of all Southern white men of military age died in the War. Until Vietnam, more people had died in the Civil War than all other American wars combined. An interest which compelled that amount of death and suffering must be something more than vague disagreement over a "way of life."</p>

<p>While I was reading McPherson, <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-119">I was listening to recordings of David Blight's course at Yale, The Civil War and Reconstruction</a>. The great thing about this was I could listen to it while I was gaming, cooking, cleaning, or driving. Blight helps me put the economic portions that McPherson's work talks about in perspective. This stunning quote, for instance, blew me away:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span>...by 1860, there were more millionaires (slaveholders all) living in the lower Mississippi Valley than anywhere else in the United States. In the same year, the nearly 4 million American slaves were worth some $3.5 billion, making them the largest single financial asset in the entire U.S. economy, worth more than all manufacturing and railroads combined. So, of course, the war was rooted in these two expanding and competing economies</span>—<span>but competing over what? What eventually tore asunder America's political culture was slavery's expansion into the Western territories. </span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I quote that a lot, because it contradicts this idea of enslavement as ancillary to American history, and establishes it as foundational. Blight was pulling from Roger Ransom's incredible paper, <a href="http://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-economics-of-the-civil-war/">The Economics of the Civil War</a>. Again, the numbers are simply mind-bending—in a state like South Carolina, almost 60 percent of the people were enslaved. Beyond the numbers, Blight's lectures brought to life the words of the actual people who were enslaved. Pulling from a great number of oral sources, Blight bids us not to forget that there were actual humans, not abstract figures, who were being enslaved.</p>

<p>In understanding the humanity of the enslaved, I don't know if there is a better book than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Times-Frederick-Douglass-African-American/dp/0486431703"><em>The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass</em></a>. Because Douglass wrote three autobiographies, and <em>Life and Times</em> is the longest, it tends to get short shrift. But, for my money, it's the best of the three and one of the most beautiful autobiographies ever written by an American. Douglass's portrait of slavery is just gripping. Forgive me for quoting at length:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The close-fisted stinginess that fed the poor slave on coarse corn-meal and tainted meat, that clothed him in crashy tow-linen and hurried him on to toil through the field in all weathers, with wind and rain beating through his tattered garments, and that scarcely gave even the young slave-mother time to nurse her infant in the fence-corner, wholly vanished on approaching the sacred precincts of the "Great House" itself. There the scriptural phrase descriptive of the wealthy found exact illustration. The highly-favored inmates of this mansion were literally arrayed in "purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day."</p>

<p>The table of this house groaned under the blood-bought luxuries gathered with pains-taking care at home and abroad. Fields, forests, rivers, and seas were made tributary. Immense wealth and its lavish expenditures filled the Great House with all that could please the eye or tempt the taste. Fish, flesh, and fowl were here in profusion. Chickens of all breeds; ducks of all kinds, wild and tame, the common and the huge Muscovite; Guinea fowls, turkeys, geese and pea-fowls; all were fat and fattening for the destined vortex...</p>

<p>Alas, this immense wealth, this gilded splendor, this profusion of luxury, this exemption from toil. this life of ease, this sea of plenty were not the pearly gates they seemed to a world of happiness and sweet content to be. The poor slave, on his hard pine plank, scantily covered with his thin blanket, slept more soundly than the feverish voluptuary who reclined upon his downy pillow. Food to the indolent is poison, not sustenance. Lurking beneath the rich and tempting viands were invisible spirits of evil, which filled the self-deluded gormandizer with aches and pains, passions uncontrollable, fierce tempers, dyspepsia, rheumatism, lumbago, and gout, and of these the Lloyds had a full share.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Douglass is a masterful narrator, and one of the things he communicates is that slavery is not a sanitized form of forced labor, but first and foremost, a system of violence, an assault on black bodies, black families, and black institutions. This all gets lost in the talk about economics and robbing people of their work. That robbery was abetted by the destruction of people. For me no book better captures this then Thavolia Glymph's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Out-House-Bondage-Transformation-Plantation/dp/0521703980"><em>Out of The House of Bondage</em></a>. Glymph is specifically interested in the violence that allegedly mild slave-mistresses visited upon their slaves. By focusing on what people think of us as the mildest form of slavery (the domestic) Glymph reveals that enslavement is not violent sometimes, but is, itself, a form of violence.</p><div class="pagebreak"></div>

<p>Picking up from <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations-a-narrative-bibliography/372000/">yesterday's readings on racism as a "done thing,"</a> as a choice, these readings helped me understand why that choice was made and how essential it was to the American project. And if that is the case, if enslavement was essential, how could it be that its effects faded in 1860? Douglass says "a man is worked on by what he works on." For 250 years, Americans worked on the breaking of people for profit. What I found, going forward, is that enslavement had worked on us too. You can see its ghost all over American policy, especially in the realm of housing.</p>

<p>And so the sources:</p>

<p>1.) <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Battle-Cry-Freedom-Civil-War/dp/0195038630/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid="><em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em></a>, by James McPherson</strong><br/>
Just a beautiful read. One of my favorite books of all time, and a book that does not entertain Neo-Confederate dissembling.</p>

<p>2.) <strong>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5DD220D6A1282057">The Civil War and Reconstruction</a>," David Blight's lecture series</strong><br/>
Blight is a great lecturer and covers the essentials of both periods. </p>

<p>3.) <strong>"<a href="http://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-economics-of-the-civil-war/">The Economics Of The Civil War</a>," by Roger L. Ransom</strong><br/>
This is a really short but essential read. Perhaps more than any article I've read it explains the forces that led us to war.</p>

<p>4.) <strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Times-Frederick-Douglass-Written-Himself/dp/1582183678/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=">The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass</a>, </em>by Frederick Douglass</strong><br/>
Just beautiful. Don't just read this to understand enslavement; read it because it is an incredible work of literature.</p>

<p>5.) <strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Out-House-Bondage-Transformation-Plantation/dp/0521703980">Out Of The House of Bondage</a></em>, by Thavolia Glymph</strong><br/>
I actually came to this after the reparations article was in the queue, but it crystalizes something that Douglass demonstrates--the horrific violence that was slavery. You can not divide the two. The <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/cliven-bundy-wants-to-tell-you-all-about-the-negro/361152/">Cliven Bundy fantasy of black people happily picking cotton, and living in two parent homes with food and shelter provided</a> is the exact opposite of what slavery was. You can not plunder a people nonviolently.</p><p>

            <p>As I've <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations-an-intellectual-autopsy/371125/">said before</a>, the idea of reparations precedes this month's cover of <em>The Atlantic</em>, and the work around it—among scholars, activists, and writers—has been ongoing, even if the interest of the broader world is fickle. Following up on the autopsy of an idea, I thought I'd give some larger sense of how something like this came to be. My hope is to give people who are interested some entrée into further reading, and also to credit the antecedents to my own thinking. Perhaps most importantly, I wish to return to one of the original features of blogging—the documentation of public thinking. I would suggest that more writers, more academics, and more journalists do this, and do so honestly. It have come to believe that arguing with the self is as important as arguing with the broader world.</p>

<p>Okay. On y va.</p>

<!--INSERT IN_ARTICLE AD--><p>Recently, a young woman told me that this generation of Americans was "the most diverse in American history." The assumption was that across the span of that history, there was some immutable group of racial categories whose numbers we could compare. I am not sure this holds up. Biracial is a new category for America, but it is not clear to me that today there are relatively more children of black and white unions than there were in the past. We certainly are more apt to acknowledge them as such, and that is a good thing. Nevertheless, the assumption of that "something new" is happening "racially," that these terms are somehow constant is one of the great, and underestimated, barriers to understanding the case for reparations.</p>

<hr/></aside><!-- END "MORE ON" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --><p>The myth of any such constant was exposed to me at Howard University. I was a history major—and yes, I am bragging about this, and not at all humbly. In all my history classes we were treated to the dizzying taxonomy of race—mulatto and Italian, creole and quadroon, Jew and mestizo. This terminology would change quickly, change back, and then change again. And borders would change with them. Not even continents were constant. "Africa begins at the Pyrenees," we read in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Z._Ripley#The_Races_of_Europe"><em>The Races of Europe</em></a>.</p>

<p>No work more influenced my own thinking on this more than St. Clair Drake's two-volume work <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Folk-Here-There-Anthropology/dp/0934934290/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401758382&amp;sr=1-5"><em>Black Folk Here and There</em></a>. Drake is better known for his study of Chicago, <em>Black Metropolis</em>, a book that informed the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/01/american-girl/307211/">profile</a> I wrote of Michelle Obama and, to some extent, my work on reparations. But<em> Black Folk</em> was the first book that made the argument that sticks with me to this day—that there is nothing particularly "natural" about viewing people with darker skin and curlier hair as inferior. Drake surveys all perceptions of people with darker skin, curlier hair, or both across history. He finds very little consistency and concludes that racism, as we know it, is basically a product of the slave trade, which is to say the seizure of power.</p>

<p>Other books confirmed Drake's basic insight to me—Allison Blakely's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0253214335/?tag=googhydr-20&amp;hvadid=44775609345&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=14951300703345405324&amp;hvpone=25.84&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;ref=pd_sl_6gyo4l0mce_e">Blacks in the Dutch World</a>,</em> Nell Irvin Painter's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-White-People-Irvin-Painter/dp/0393049345/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402416418&amp;sr=1-1">The History of White People</a></em>. If you can get your hands on it I also would recommend <a href="http://www.imageoftheblack.com"><em>The Image of the Black in Western Art</em></a>, which is both expensive and priceless. It's fascinating to see how black people were viewed before we decided that African ancestry made you, by God or science, property. For a energetic rebuttal (which I find ultimately unconvincing) see Winthrop Jordan's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/White-Over-Black-Attitudes-1550-1812/dp/0807845507">White Over Black</a></em>.</p>

<p>The import of this all came home for me many years later in Barbara and Karen Fields's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Racecraft-Soul-Inequality-American-Life-ebook/dp/B007LCYZCE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402416546&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=racecraft"><em>Racecraft</em></a>. The book is a collection of essay, and is sometimes hard to follow, but its basic insight is brilliant. Basically, Americans talk about "race" but not "racism," and in doing that they turn a series of "actions" into a "state." This is basically true of all our conversations of this sort, left and right. You can see this in all our terminology—racial justice, racial quotas, racial discrimination, etc. But this language is ahistorical, and it obscures the current conflict. Affirmative action, for instance, is not intended to remedy plunder (action) but to aid "women and people of color" (state) or produce "diversity" (another state). And the benefits of affirmative action are not people who have been plundered, but "the black race."</p>

<p>But American notions of race are the product of racism, not the other way around. We know this because we can see the formation of "race" in American law and policy, and also see how formations differ across time and space. So what is "black" in the United States is not "black" in Brazil. More significantly the relevance and import of "blackness" is not constant across American history. Edmund Morgan's <em>American Slavery, American Freedom</em> helped me a lot on this. At the start of the book the English are allying with the rebellious Cimarrons against the hated and demonic Spanish. By the end of the book the great-grandchildren of the English are convinced that blacks are a singular blight upon the Earth. The change is not mysterious. Morgan traces the nexus of law, policy, and financial interest to show how current notions of "blackness" and "whiteness" were formed.</p><div class="pagebreak"></div>

<p>It is important to remember that American racism is a thing that was done, and a world where American racism is beaten back is not a world of "racial diversity" but a world without such terminology. Perhaps we can never actually get to that world. Perhaps we are just too far gone. But we should never forget that this world was "made." Whiteness and blackness are not a fact of providence, but of policy—of slave codes, black codes, Jim Crow, redlining, GI Bills, housing covenants, New Deals, and mass incarcerations.</p>

<p>I did not understand it at the time, but this way of thinking pushed me toward reparations. In the popular mind, reparations is seen as a "race-based" scheme, i.e., giving money to people solely because they are black or have direct African ancestry. But if you understand racism as the headwaters of the problem, as injury, as plunder you can reorient and focus not on the ancestry but on the injury.</p>

<p>For me it goes back to <em>Black Folks Here and There</em>. I came to St. Clair Drake feeling a deep need to prove that the Ancient Egyptians were "black." (The whole first volume is a consideration of "race" and Ancient Egypt.) I was dogged by Saul Bellow's challenge: "Who is the Tolstoy of the Zulus?" I left <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/tolstoy-is-the-tolstoy-of-the-zulus/278789/">feeling like Ralph Wiley</a>—Tolstoy is the Tolstoy of the Zulus. Wiley's point was that the entire exercise of attempting to prove the worth of humans through monuments and walls was morally flawed. This was radicalizing. It warned me away from beginning an argument with racist reasoning, by accepting its premises. The argument for racism is corrupt at its root, and must be confronted there. You can understand how such thinking might inevitably lead you toward reparations.</p>

<p>Over the next few days I'll write three more posts like this—covering enslavement, housing and domestic policy, and thinking around reparations. If I were starting out and trying to grapple the relationship between "race" and "racism," here is how I would proceed. It is not the only—and perhaps not even the best—path. It's simply the one I'd suggest.</p>

<p>1.) <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Slavery-Freedom-Edmund-Morgan/dp/039332494X"><em>American Slavery, American Freedom</em></a>, by Edmund Morgan</strong><br/>
Essential to understanding your country and how it came to see "blacks" in one light and "whites" in another.</p>

<p>2.) <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/White-Over-Black-Attitudes-1550-1812/dp/0807845507"><em>White Over Black</em></a>, by Winthrop Jordan</strong><br/>
I don't agree with this book, but it's important to confront the counterargument—that Anglo-American culture is racist at its very root and predisposed toward hatred of black people.</p>

<p>3.)<strong> <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-White-People-Irvin-Painter/dp/0393049345/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402416418&amp;sr=1-1">The History of White People</a></em>, by Nell Irvin Painter</strong><br/>
A deeply amusing book that finds great minds—chiefly Ralph Waldo Emerson—arguing that race explains why "Celts" are Catholic and "Saxons" Protestant. It also reveals how poorly racist thinking ages. The book is an eminently readable guide through the evolution and conception of white people. Again, nothing inevitable here.</p>

<p>4.) <strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Folk-Here-There-Anthropology/dp/0934934290/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401758382&amp;sr=1-5">Black Folks Here and There</a></em>, by St. Clair Drake</strong><br/>
The source for me. This book changed my life. I've listed it so low because at the time I read it, I had nothing else to do, really. I didn't do much homework. I skipped a lot of class. I just soaked stuff like this up.</p>

<p>5.) <strong><a href="http://engl101-rothman.wikispaces.umb.edu/file/view/On+Being+White+and+Other+Lies.pdf">"On Being White ... and Other Lies,"</a> by James Baldwin</strong><br/>
No one is better on the idea of "race," and particularly whiteness, and its import than Baldwin: "No one was white before he/she came to America. It took generations and a vast amount of coercion ..." In this essay, he brings together all the history and wastes no words dumbing down its likely import:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... in this debasement and definition of black people, they have debased and defined themselves. And have brought humanity to the edge of oblivion: because they think they are white. Because they think they are white, they dare not confront the ravage and lie of their history. Because they think they are white, they cannot allow themselves to be tormented by the suspicion that all men are brothers .... Because they think they are white, they believe, as even no child believes, in the dream of safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, to me, is the deepest significance of reparations. People who think this is just a matter of giving black things vastly underestimate the challenge. Reparations may seem impractical. Living without history, I suspect, will—in the long term—prove to be suicidal.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Forgive my absence these past few days. June's cover story has taken on a life of its own. But it's a life that I will soon be parting with. I am leaving you for awhile, a fact that saddens me because this space—more than any other resource—is responsible for so much of what I've learned over the past few years. That learning hasn't been limited to the comprehension of the force of racism in American history, or even American history at all.</p>

<p>As some of you know, I've spent the past two years or so grappling with the French language. It has gotten the better of me, repeatedly, piling up the humiliations like lumber. But I suspect that there is no other real way to learn at my age, and possibly not at all. This summer I expect the humiliations to increase substantially as I head off for seven weeks of intense immersion. <em>Je vais parler en français, écrire en français, lire en français, et finalment, penser et rêver en français. </em><em>Alors</em>, I can't really do this while being normal. So I won't be talking to, well, anyone in my life, except those few people who speak French. I think of this like living underwater for awhile, like exploring all the beautiful and weird things that live in the deep. </p>

<!--INSERT IN_ARTICLE AD--><p>After next Thursday, you will not hear from me for awhile. I want to thank the Francophone Horde who've talked to me, and chatted with me <em>en français</em> as I have grappled with the language. My first French tutor rose up from the horde and, Kathleen, I am forever in your debt. I want to thank my editors James Bennet, Scott Stossel, John Gould, and Bob Cohn for supporting me in this. I have long believed that the best part of writing is not the communication of knowledge to other people, but the acquisition and synthesizing of knowledge for oneself. The best thing I can say about the reparations piece is that I now understand. I can not control what others do. But I can understand as much as possible in the short time I have with you. </p>

<p>Best,</p>

I appreciate David's engagement with the issue. I often miss the old days when </span><i>The Atlantic</i><span>'s writers would engage each other in running debate, so I'm happy for the chance to get back into that kind of conversation here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">On y va. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">David grounds his rebuttal in The Philadelphia Plan, an affirmative action program that David believes qualifies as reparations. I disagree. The Philadelphia Plan was an attempt to end job discrimination among firms doing business with the federal government. </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Originally it was isolated to the building trades in Philadelphia. This was not a mistake. "The NAACP wanted a tougher require; the unions hated the whole thing," said White House aide John Ehrlichman. "Before long, the AFL-CIO and the NAACP were locked in combat over one of the passionate issues of the day and the Nixon administration was located in the sweet and reasonable middle."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The Plan's proprietors showed little stomach for any kind of historical reckoning. President Richard Nixon's Assistant Secretary of Labor Arthur Fletcher, who helped create the Plan, targeted not just blacks, but </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">"Orientals, American Indians and persons with Spanish surnames." </span></p>

<p><span>More importantly, The Philadelphia Plan was focused on ending present racist discrimination, not compensating for the past.</span><font style="font-size: 16px;"> In Philadelphia, a city that was 30 percent black, there were 12 minority unionized ironworkers and three black </font><span style="font-size: 16px;">pipe-fitters</span><font style="font-size: 16px;">. There was no black unionized work among the sheet metal trades, elevator constructors, or the stone-masons. From the perspective of reparations, one might calculate how much this discrimination had cost Philadelphia's black community and then attempt to compensate them. The Philadelphia Plan did not do this. Indeed Fletcher went so far as to declare himself neither</font><span style="font-size: 16px;"> interested in compensation nor "a fruitless debate about slavery and its debilitating legacy." </span><span style="font-size: medium;">The Philadelphia Plan was no more reparations than school busing was reparations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The White House's appetite for these "reparations" proved short lived. In 1970, Nixon took The Philadelphia Plan national, expanding beyond the trades. In 1972, he ran against his own plan. Fletcher was forced out. The Democrats were tarred as the</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> "quota party." </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">"The zip went out of that integration effort," said then aide William Safire, "after the hard hats marched in support of Nixon on the war." So much for "reparations."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">And so much for history. David goes on to assert that reparations for one group must necessarily lead to reparations for all groups</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">: </span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span>With any program of reparations, likewise, other claimants will come forward. If African Americans are due payment for slavery and subjugation, what about Native Americans, who lost a whole continent? What about Mexican-Americans, who were deprived by the Mexican-American war of the right to migrate into half their former country? Japanese Americans, interned during World War II? Chinese Americans, the victims of coolie labor and the Oriental Exclusion Acts? Members of these groups may concede that they were not maltreated in the same way as African Americans—and may not be entitled to exactly the same consideration. But if black Americans are entitled to almost a trillion dollars in compensation (Coates suggests a figure of $34 billion a year “for a decade or two”) surely these other maltreated groups must be entitled at least to something?</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This argument carries the virus of its own destruction. In fact reparations <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/08/09/210138278/japanese-internment-redress">paid to Japanese-Americans</a> for internment has been American policy for over 20 years.<span style="font-size: 16px;"> No reparations for African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, or Chinese-Americans followed. Even German-Americans and Italian-Americans who were also interned received no reparations. </span></p>

<p><font size="3">The Japanese-American struggle for reparations is significant and important, not just for our present discussion, but because it serves as useful corrective for </font>hagiographers<font size="3"> of war. </font><span style="font-size: 16px;">And it is not an obscure episode.</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Indeed, Japanese-American reparations were in the news this week, with the death </span><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/06/02/318072652/japanese-american-activist-and-malcolm-x-ally-dies-at-93" style="font-size: 16px;">of activist Yuri Kochiyama</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, one of the principal advocates of the cause. David treats Japanese-American reparations as an open question or a thought experiment. But it isn't. </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">It's American history—and people charged with analyzing America should know it.</span></p>

<p>People who take up reparations arguments should especially know it because it presents us with some provocative questions. The collective ills of housing segregation—block-busting, redlining, segregated public-housing, the G.I. Bill, terrorism—continued long <span style="font-size: 16px;">after Japanese-American internment. A serious interlocutor of reparations can not casually muster a melange of historical wrongs, but must directly explain why the Japanese-American case is compelling, but the more recent African-American case is not. </span></p>

<p>Slippery slopes will not do. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The "If we give them one, they'll all have one" argument is demonstrably false. This is as it should be. The argument for black reparations is not simply "Hey guys, we did it for the Japanese-Americans so it must be right." A claim must stand on its arguments. Nothing would please me more than to read a 15,000 word "Case for Native American Reparations." I say this because we can't evaluate particular claims without understanding particular history.</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> David, like many who believe reparations to be "impossible," is anxious to skip the history and leap to implementation. But the questions, themselves, prove that we are not prepared.</span></p><div class="pagebreak"></div>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">"Does a mixed-raced person qualify?" David asks. Probably so, given that there are very few "pure raced" black people who were injured by racism. Indeed, the lack of "purity" is parcel to the injury. Perhaps David wants to ask "Do black people with direct 'white' ancestry qualify?" The correct reply to this is "Were black people with direct 'white' ancestry victims of racist housing policy?" The answer to that question is knowable. But it is not the question we ask. Instead we focus on the myth of "race," while ignoring the demonstrable fact of injury. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">This species of ignorance</span>—<span style="font-size: 16px;">of looking away</span>—<span style="font-size: 16px;">is old. In 1884, Harvard scientist Nathaniel Shaler assessed "The Negro Problem" in the pages </span><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ioxAGUJSdFcC&amp;pg=PA699&amp;lpg=PA699&amp;dq=%22There+can+be+no+sort+of+doubt,+that,+judged%22+by+the+light+of+all+experience,+these+people+are+a+danger+to+America+greater&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SjnK0mJ_Te&amp;sig=If4D2CrrxM7koPlFQZLOCDuOr_c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OPCOU62cE7OhsAS71YDQDA&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22it%20was%20their%20presence%22&amp;f=false" style="font-size: 16px;">of this very magazine.</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Shaler concluded that:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was their presence here that was the evil, and for this none of the men of our century are responsible ... The burden lies on the souls of our dull, greedy ancestors of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, who were too stupid to see or too careless to consider anything but immediate gain ...</p>

<p><font size="3">There can be no sort of doubt, that, judged by the light of all experience, these people are a danger to America greater and more insuperable than any of those that menace the other great civilized states of the world. The armies of the Old World, the inheritance of medievalism  in its </font>governments<font size="3">, the chance evils of Ireland and Sicily, are all light burdens when compared with this load of African negro blood that an evil past has imposed upon us.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the very moment that Shaler was disowning American responsibility for enslavement, there were thousands, perhaps millions, of freedmen alive as well as their enslavers. It had barely been 20 years since enslavement was abolished. It had not been ten years since the rout of Reconstruction. In that time, sensible claims for reparations were being made. The black activist Callie House argued that pensions should be paid to freedmen and freedwomen for unpaid toil. The movement garnered Congressional support. But it failed, largely because, the country believed as Shaler did, that "none of the men of this century" were "responsible."</p>

<p>A similar moment finds us now. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Even if one feels that slavery was too far into the deep past (and I do not, because I view this as a continuum) the immediate past is with us. Identifying the victims of racist housing policy in this country is not hard. Again, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/">we have the maps.</a> <a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html">We have the census</a>. We could set up a claims system for black veterans who were frustrated in their attempt to use the G.I. Bill. We could then decide what remedy we might offer these people and their communities. And there is nothing "impractical" about this.</span></p>

<p>The problem of reparations has never been practicality. It has always been the awesome ghosts of history. A fear of ghosts has sometimes occupied the pages of the magazine for which David and I now write. In other times <a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/pdf/2014/05/mcpherson-contract-buyers.pdf">banishment has been our priority</a>. The mature citizen, the hard student, is now called to choose between finding a reason to confront the past, or finding more reasons to hide from it.<span style="font-size: 16px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">David thinks HR-40 commits us to a solution. He is correct. The solution is to study. I submit his own article as proof of why such study is so deeply needed. </span></p>

<ul><li><small>Terry Anderson's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Pursuit-Fairness-History-Affirmative/dp/0195182456">The Pursuit of Fairness</a></em> is a thorough review of the history affirmative action, a policy that many people talk about but fail to understand. Quotes of Fletcher and Ehrlichman are taken from Anderson's book.</small></li>
	<li><small>Mary Francis Berry's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Face-Black-True-Reparations-ebook/dp/B002HHPVNU/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401880897&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=my+face+is+black+is+true">My Face Is Black Is True</a></em>, is a chronicle of one of the earliest efforts, post-enslavement, for reparations led by the remarkable Callie House. </small></li>
	<li><small>Khalil Gibran Muhammad's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Condemnation-Blackness-Making-Modern-America-ebook/dp/B008TTMGA6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401881046&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+condemnation+of+blackness">The Condemnation of Blackness</a></em>, is a useful corrective to the deceptive invocations of "black on black crime." Muhammad demonstrates that much of rhetoric around "black crime" is old and has its roots in our racist past.</small></li>
