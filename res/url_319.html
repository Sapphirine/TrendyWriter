As our colleague Andrea Mitchell put it so well: This is hardly the legacy that President Obama wanted. And it helps to explain why it took him so long to announce it. In his primetime speech from the White House, the president said the campaign against ISIS would be a sustained counterterrorism strategy similar to how the administration is combating terrorism in places like Yemen and Somalia -- with airstrikes and support but no U.S. combat troops. He said the United States had assembled a coalition to fight ISIS, with the Iraqi government, Kurdish forces and moderate Syrians providing the manpower. He called on Congress to authorize resources to train and equip the Syrian opposition. And he admitted the campaign wouldn’t be a short one. Indeed, as the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/world/middleeast/extending-a-legacy-of-war.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=LedeSum&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">New York Times’ Baker writes</a>, Obama will likely be leaving this war to his successor in office. All of this “may have ensured that he would pass his successor a volatile and incomplete war, much as his predecessor left one for him.”"},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Unanswered questions from last night</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Obama’s plan to combat ISIS presents as many questions as answers. What does success look like? (If Yemen and Somalia are the examples, it’s worth noting that the campaigns there have, at best, degraded the terrorists but have hardly destroyed them.) What do you do with Assad? And how does this all end? In fact, that last question points to perhaps the biggest shortcoming from Obama’s speech. How long does this last? And at what cost? We didn’t get those answers last night."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Tempered praise from Republicans</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Despite those unanswered questions, here’s the most interesting part from last night’s speech: It got more Republican support than anything Obama has done in his second term. “I support the president taking military action in Iraq and Syria to combat this organization. I also support his request for additional authority to support the moderate, vetted Syrian opposition. But more must be done,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. Added Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham: “While we strongly disagree with President Obama that America is safer today than five years ago, his speech tonight got some key things right. He explained to the American people why we must confront ISIS.” Yes, Republicans took some shots at the president. And, yes, some have disagreed with him taking U.S. combat forces off the table. But it’s been a long time since so many Republicans have showered this much praise -- no matter how tempered -- on the president. And for their part, Democratic leaders were pretty complimentary as well, though other Dems <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/217379-democrats-split-on-obamas-plans-for-isis\">were split on the speech</a>. In short, Obama will have Congress’ support taking the fight to ISIS. But sustaining it over months and years? That will be tougher."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Security pendulum swings back</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"On this anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, note that it’s just not our NBC/WSJ poll showing that the security pendulum has swung back with the ISIS news in the headlines. According to a new <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2014/09/10/growing-concern-about-rise-of-islamic-extremism-at-home-and-abroad/\">Pew poll</a>, 50% of Americans say U.S. anti-terror policies haven't gone FAR ENOUGH to protect the country, vs. 35% who say they've gone TOO FAR in restricting civil liberties. That's a significant reversal from last year after the Snowden revelations. In July 2013, Americans by a 47%-35% margin said that anti-terror policies had gone too far. And the numbers were similar in Nov. 2013: 44% said they had gone too far, while 39% said they hadn't gone far enough."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Gender gap still keeping Democrats in the game</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Yesterday we wrote how our NBC/WSJ poll showed Democrats at the tipping point of big losses this midterm season. But the poll also revealed a silver lining that could limit their losses: the gender gap. In our latest survey, women preferred a Democratic-controlled Congress by seven points, 47%-40%. Although that’s down from our previous polls and although Republicans have an ever bigger lead among men (12 points), do note that our Sept. 2010 NBC/WSJ poll showed Democrats with just a three-point edge among female voters, 46%-43%. Bottom line: Democrats holding on to the Senate will largely come down to whether they win women by double digits in November. Another voting bloc keeping Democrats in the game: independents. Our poll had Republicans with a three-point lead among indies, 33%-30%, which is down from their 14-point advantage in Sept. 2010."},{"type":"p","html":"<strong>Looking at the Latino vote</strong>"},{"type":"p","html":"Our poll also included an NBC/WSJ/Telemundo oversample among Latino voters (336 were interviewed), and the findings are striking.

It’s not my birthday, nor that of either of my children. It’s not a graduation date nor is it a national holiday."},{"type":"p","html":"Sunday, March 1, 1981 is the day when my life changed forever and it’s the day I became a resident of the United States of America."},{"type":"p","html":"I remember landing at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City on a cold afternoon. There was snow on the ground and I had never seen snow. As a tropical child, I feared the white and unfamiliar <em>nieve</em>. Hours earlier I had boarded a Dominicana Airlines flight in Santo Domingo and I can guarantee there was no nieve on the ground in that capital city. In fact, the average temperature for March in the DR is 80 degrees. There were snowcones -- <em>frío frío</em> – but certainly none of that incomprehensible cold, white stuff Americanos had to deal with."},{"type":"p","html":"To this day, I remember the mixed emotions of leaving the only place I knew. On one hand, I was leaving behind a loving grandmother and grandfather whom I fiercely adored. I was leaving uncles, aunts and cousins. I was leaving friends with whom I played cops and robbers and who shared my love for those plastic green soldiers. Who wants to lose that network at the age of seven?"},{"type":"p","html":"But I knew what, and who, awaited me on the other side of customs at JFK. I hadn’t seen my father in almost a year and my mother in three. I yearned for them and missed them and I wanted to desperately be with them. I knew a different language was spoken in <em>The Nueva York </em>and it didn’t matter. I knew the weather was different and it didn’t matter. I knew by regaining my parents, I was leaving others I loved, but it didn’t matter."},{"type":"p","html":"I was handed a gray peacoat, gloves and a Superman snow hat. I was given hugs by my parents.

The public schools in this town are among the best one could imagine, but imagine the terror I felt at not speaking the language. I knew nobody at school and I couldn’t communicate, except with my fists. If I felt I was being teased, I acted out and felt no better after each ordeal. I know I was scared, but I know the other kids were more scared to say anything to me."},{"type":"p","html":"My school did not offer bilingual classes, but I remember attending English as a Second Language classes a few hours a week during the school day. In hindsight, I know this experience helped me acquire the language more quickly, though perhaps at the expense of my first language.

I thought this was helping her, but I know now it was also helping me. Without those bilingual conversations, my Spanish would have degraded and disappeared."},{"type":"p","html":"Preserving my Spanish would serve me well; I’ve worked for both Univision and Telemundo.

What I know is that at some point my dreams, and the conversations contained within them, were no longer in Spanish. I marvel at how the brain works when it comes to language, and I believe dreaming in English was a turning point. It was now English first.
