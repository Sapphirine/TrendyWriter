<br />
<strong>ONE ICY MORNING</strong> in February 2012, Hillary Clinton's plane touched down in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, which was just digging out from a fierce blizzard. Wrapped in a thick coat, the secretary of state descended the stairs to the snow-covered tarmac, where she and her aides piled into a motorcade bound for the presidential palace. That afternoon, they huddled with Bulgarian leaders, including Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, discussing everything from Syria's bloody civil war to their joint search for loose nukes. But the focus of the talks was fracking. The previous year, Bulgaria had signed a five-year, $68 million deal, granting US oil giant Chevron millions of acres in shale gas concessions. Bulgarians were outraged. Shortly before Clinton arrived, tens of thousands of protesters poured into the streets carrying <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/bulgaria-chevron-fracking_n_1210299.html" target="_hplink">placards</a> that read "Stop fracking with our water" and "Chevron go home." Bulgaria's parliament responded by voting overwhelmingly for a fracking moratorium.<br />
<br />
Clinton urged Bulgarian officials to give fracking another chance. According to Borissov, she <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2012/02/183342.htm" target="_hplink">agreed</a> to help fly in the "best specialists on these new technologies to present the benefits to the Bulgarian people." But resistance only grew. The following month in neighboring Romania, thousands of people gathered to protest another Chevron fracking project, and Romania's parliament began weighing its own shale gas moratorium. Again Clinton intervened, dispatching her special envoy for energy in Eurasia, Richard Morningstar, to push back against the fracking bans. The State Depart­ment's lobbying effort culminated in late May 2012, when Morningstar held a series of meetings on fracking with top Bulgarian and Romanian officials. He also touted the technology in an interview on Bulgarian national radio, saying it could lead to a fivefold drop in the price of natural gas. A few weeks later, Romania's parliament voted down its proposed fracking ban and Bulgaria's eased its moratorium.<br />
<br />
The episode sheds light on a crucial but little-known dimension of Clinton's diplomatic legacy. Under her leadership, the State Department worked closely with energy companies to spread fracking around the globe—part of a broader push to fight climate change, boost global energy supply, and undercut the power of adversaries such as Russia that use their energy resources as a cudgel. But environmental groups fear that exporting fracking, which has been linked to <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/10/radioactivity-fracking-waste-pennsylvania" target="_hplink">drinking-water contamination</a> and <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/03/does-fracking-cause-earthquakes-wastewater-dewatering" target="_hplink">earthquakes</a> at home, could wreak havoc in countries with scant environmental regulation. And according to interviews, diplomatic cables, and other documents obtained by <em>Mother Jones</em>, American officials—some with deep ties to industry—also helped US firms clinch potentially lucrative shale concessions overseas, raising troubling questions about whose interests the program actually serves.<br />

<br />
<strong>GEOLOGISTS HAVE LONG KNOWN</strong> that there were huge quantities of natural gas locked in shale rock. But tapping it wasn't economically viable until the late 1990s, when a Texas wildcatter named <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/news/the-lives-they-lived/2013/12/21/george-mitchell/" target="_hplink">George Mitchell</a> hit on a novel extraction method that involved drilling wells sideways from the initial borehole, then blasting them full of water, chemicals, and sand to break up the shale—a variation of a technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Besides dislodging a bounty of natural gas, Mitchell's breakthrough ignited an energy revolution. Between 2006 and 2008, domestic gas reserves jumped <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/18/business/energy-environment/18gas.html?_r=1&" target="_hplink">35 percent</a>. The United States later vaulted past Russia to become the world's largest natural gas producer. As a result, prices dropped to record lows, and America began to wean itself from coal, along with oil and gas imports, which lessened its dependence on the Middle East. The surging global gas supply also helped shrink Russia's economic clout: Profits for Russia's state-owned gas company, Gazprom, plummeted by more than 60 percent between 2008 and 2009 alone.<br />
<br />
Clinton, who was sworn in as secretary of state in early 2009, believed that shale gas could help rewrite global energy politics. "This is a moment of profound change," she later <a href="http://translations.state.gov/st/english/texttrans/2012/10/20121018137692.html#axzz3Cv4dWeFD" target="_hplink">told a crowd</a> at Georgetown University. "Countries that used to depend on others for their energy are now producers. How will this shape world events? Who will benefit, and who will not?…The answers to these questions are being written right now, and we intend to play a major role." Clinton tapped a lawyer named David Goldwyn as her special envoy for international energy affairs; <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ciea/rmk/130461.htm" target="_hplink">his charge</a> was "to elevate energy diplomacy as a key function of US foreign policy."<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:20px;float:right;margin:20px;width:200px">"Countries that used to depend on others for their energy are now producers," said Clinton. "How will this shape world events? Who will benefit?…The answers to these questions are being written right now, and we intend to play a major role."</span><br />
<br />
Goldwyn had a long history of promoting drilling overseas—both as a Department of Energy official under Bill Clinton and as a representative of the oil industry. From 2005 to 2009 he directed the US-Libya Business Association, an organization funded primarily by US oil companies—including Chevron, Exxon Mobil, and Marathon—clamoring to tap Libya's abundant supply. Goldwyn lobbied Congress for pro-Libyan policies and even battled legislation that would have allowed families of the Lockerbie bombing victims to sue the Libyan government for its alleged role in the attack.<br />
<br />
According to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09STATE111742_a.html" target="_hplink">diplomatic cables</a> released by WikiLeaks, one of Goldwyn's first acts at the State Department was gathering oil and gas industry executives "to discuss the potential international impact of shale gas." Clinton then sent a cable to US diplomats, asking them to collect information on the potential for fracking in their host countries. These efforts eventually gave rise to the <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ciea/rmk/146249.htm" target="_hplink">Global Shale Gas Initiative</a>, which aimed to help other nations develop their shale potential. Clinton <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2010/04/140286.htm" target="_hplink">promised</a> it would do so "in a way that is as environmentally respectful as possible."<br />
<br />
But environmental groups were barely consulted, while industry played a crucial role. When Goldwyn unveiled the initiative in April 2010, it was at a meeting of the United States Energy Association, a trade organization representing Chevron, Exxon Mobil, and ConocoPhillips, all of which were pursuing fracking overseas. Among their top targets was Poland, which preliminary studies suggested had abundant shale gas. The day after Goldwyn's announcement, the US Embassy in Warsaw helped organize a shale gas conference, underwritten by these same companies (plus the oil field services company Halliburton) and attended by officials from the departments of State and Energy.<br />
<br />
In some cases, Clinton personally promoted shale gas. During a 2010 gathering of foreign ministers in Washington, DC, she spoke about America's plans to help spread fracking abroad. "I know that in some places [it] is controversial," <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2010/04/140286.htm" target="_hplink">she said</a>, "but natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today." She later traveled to Poland for a series of meetings with officials, after which she announced that the country had joined the Global Shale Gas Initiative.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:20px;float:left;margin:20px;width:200px">"We are very firm on this," insists the State Department's Paul Hueper. "We do not shill for industry."</span><br />
<br />
That August, delegates from 17 countries descended on Washington for the State Depart­ment's first shale gas conference. The media was barred from attending, and officials refused to reveal basic information, including which countries took part. When Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) inquired about industry involvement, the department would say only that there had been "a limited industry presence." (State Department officials have since been more forthcoming with <em>Mother Jones</em>: In addition to a number of US government agencies, they say attendees heard from energy firms, including Devon, Chesapeake, and Halliburton.)<br />
<br />
During the cursory <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ciea/rmk/146249.htm" target="_hplink">press conference</a> that followed, Goldwyn, a short, bespectacled man with a shock of dark hair, argued that other nations could avoid the environmental damage sometimes associated with fracking by following America's lead and adopting "an umbrella of laws and regulations." A reporter suggested that US production had actually "outpaced the ability to effectively oversee the safety" and asked how we could be sure the same wouldn't happen elsewhere. Goldwyn replied that attendees had heard about safety issues from energy companies and the Groundwater Protection Council, a nonprofit organization that receives <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/documents/1237898-american-petroleum-institute-990-form#document/p50/a169292" target="_hplink">industry funding</a> and opposes federal regulation of fracking wastewater disposal.<br />
<br />
Goldwyn and the delegates then boarded a bus to Pennsylvania for an industry-sponsored luncheon and tour of some shale fields. Paul Hueper, director of energy programs at the State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources, says the tour was organized independently and that energy firms were only invited to the conference itself to share best practices. "We are very firm on this," he insisted. "We do not shill for industry."<br />
<br />
<strong>WHILE THE MEETING</strong> helped stir up interest, it wasn't until 2011 that global fracking fever set in for real. That spring, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its initial estimate of global shale gas, which <a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/" target="_hplink">found</a> that 32 countries had viable shale basins and put global recoverable shale gas at 6,600 trillion cubic feet—enough to supply the world for more than 50 years at current rates of consumption. This was a rich opportunity for big oil and gas companies, which had largely missed out on the US fracking boom and were under pressure from Wall Street to shore up their dwindling reserves. "They're desperate," says Antoine Simon, who coordinates the shale gas campaign at Friends of the Earth Europe. "It's the last push to continue their fossil fuel development."<br />
<br />
<div style="width:240px; margin:10px; float:right;"><img src="http://www.motherjones.com/files/gas_lands.gif" /><p><div style="width:340;font-size:90%;"></div></p></div><br />
<br />
The industry began fighting hard for access to shale fields abroad, and promoting gas as the fuel of choice for slashing carbon emissions. In Europe, lobbyists circulated a <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/documents/1237926-making-the-green-journey-work" target="_hplink">report</a> claiming that the European Union could save 900 billion euros if it invested in gas rather than renewable energy to meet its 2050 climate targets. This rankled environmentalists, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/09/methane-fracking-obama-climate-change-bill-mckibben" target="_hplink">who argue</a> fracking may do little to ease global warming, given that wells and pipelines <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/08/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-raymond-pierrehumbert-inquiring-minds" target="_hplink">leak large quantities of methane</a>, a potent greenhouse gas. They also fear it could crowd out investment in renewables.<br />
<br />
By early 2011, the State Department was laying plans to launch a new bureau to integrate energy into every aspect of foreign policy—an idea Goldwyn had long been advocating. In 2005, he and a Chevron executive named Jan Kalicki had published a book called <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/book/energy-and-security-toward-new-foreign-policy-strategy" target="_hplink">Energy and Security: Toward a New Foreign Policy Strategy</a>, which argued that energy independence was unattainable in the near term and urged Washington to shift its focus to energy security—by boosting global fossil fuel production and stifling unrest that might upset energy markets. Goldwyn and his ideas had played a key role in shaping the bureau, so some observers were surprised when he quietly stepped down just before its launch.<br />
<br />
When I approached Goldwyn following a recent speaking engagement in Washington, DC, to ask about his time at the State Department and why he left, he ducked out a side door, and Kalicki blocked the corridor to keep me from following. Goldwyn later said via email that he had simply chosen "to return to the private sector."<br />
<br />
Around the time of his departure, WikiLeaks released a slew of diplomatic cables, including one describing a 2009 meeting during which Goldwyn and Canadian officials discussed development of the Alberta oil sands—a project benefiting some of the same firms behind the US-Libya Business Association. The <a href="https://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/10/09OTTAWA771.html" target="_hplink">cable</a> said that Goldwyn had coached his Canadian counterparts on improving "oil sands messaging" and helped alleviate their concerns about getting oil sands crude to US markets. This embarrassed the State Department, which is reviewing the controversial Keystone XL pipeline proposal to transport crude oil from Canada and is under fire from environmentalists.<br />
<br />
After leaving State, Goldwyn took a job with Sutherland, a law and lobbying firm that touts his "deep understanding" of pipeline issues, and launched his own company, Goldwyn Global Strategies.<br />
<br />
In late 2011, Clinton finally unveiled the new <a href="http://www.state.gov/e/enr/" target="_hplink">Bureau of Energy Resources</a>, with 63 employees and a multimillion-dollar budget. She also <a href="http://translations.state.gov/st/english/texttrans/2012/10/20121018137692.html#axzz3Cv4dWeFD" target="_hplink">promised</a> to instruct US embassies around the globe to step up their work on energy issues and "pursue more outreach to private-sector energy" firms, some of which had generously supported both her and President Barack Obama's political campaigns. (One Chevron executive bundled large sums for Clinton's 2008 presidential bid, for example.)<br />
<br />
As part of its expanded energy mandate, the State Department hosted conferences on fracking from Thailand to Botswana. It sent US experts to work alongside foreign officials as they developed shale gas programs. And it arranged for dozens of foreign delegations to visit the United States to attend workshops and meet with industry consultants—as well as with environmental groups, in some cases.<br />
<br />
US oil giants, meanwhile, were snapping up natural gas leases in far-flung places. By 2012, Chevron had large shale concessions in Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, and South Africa, as well as in Eastern Europe, which was in the midst of a claim-staking spree; <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/26/polands_shale_gas_dream" target="_hplink">Poland alone</a> had granted more than 100 shale concessions covering nearly a third of its territory. When the nation lit its first shale gas flare atop a Halliburton-drilled well that fall, the state-owned gas company ran full-page ads in the country's largest newspapers showing a spindly rig rising above the hills in the tiny village of Lubocino, alongside the tagline: "Don't put out the flame of hope." Politicians promised that Poland would soon break free of its nemesis, Russia, which supplies the lion's share of its gas. "After years of dependence on our large neighbor, today we can say that my generation will see the day when we will be independent in the area of natural gas," Prime Minister Donald Tusk declared. "And we will be setting terms."<br />
<br />
<img src=http://www.motherjones.com/files/Urkaine_map.gif width=570 /><br />
<br />
But shale was not the godsend that industry leaders and foreign governments had hoped it would be. For one, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/documents/1237933-usgs-polish-shale-gas-report" target="_hplink">new research</a> from the US Geological Survey suggested that the EIA assessments had grossly overestimated shale deposits: The recoverable shale gas estimate for Poland shrank from 187 trillion cubic feet to 1.3 trillion cubic feet, a 99 percent drop. Geological conditions and other factors in Europe and Asia also made fracking more arduous and expensive; one industry study <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-29/shale-gas-drilling-cost-in-poland-triple-u-s-schlumberger-says.html" target="_hplink">estimated</a> that drilling shale gas in Poland would cost three times what it does in the United States.<br />
<br />
By 2013, US oil giants were abandoning their Polish shale plays. "The expectations for global shale gas were extremely high," says the State Department's Hueper. "But the geological limitations and aboveground challenges are immense. A handful of countries have the potential for a boom, but there may never be a global shale gas revolution."<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:20px;float:right;margin:20px;width:200px">"They're desperate," says Antoine Simon of Friends of the Earth Europe. "It's the last push to continue their fossil fuel development."</span><br />
<br />
The politics of fracking overseas were also fraught. According to Susan Sakmar, a visiting law professor at the University of Houston who has studied fracking regulation, the United States is one of the only nations where individual landowners own the mineral rights. "In most, perhaps all, other countries of the world, the underground resources belong to the crown or the government," she explains. The fact that property owners didn't stand to profit from drilling on their land ignited public outrage in some parts of the world, especially Eastern Europe. US officials speculate that Russia also had a hand in fomenting protests there. "The perception among diplomats in the region was that Russia was protecting its interests," says Mark Gitenstein, the former US ambassador to Romania. "It didn't want shale gas for obvious reasons."<br />
<br />
Faced with these obstacles, US and European energy companies launched a lobbying blitz targeting the European Union. They formed faux grassroots organizations, plied lawmakers with industry-funded studies, and hosted lavish dinners and conferences for regulators. The website for one industry confab—which, according to Friends of the Earth Europe, featured presentations from Exxon Mobil, Total, and Halliburton—<a href="http://www.quaynote.com/ankiti/www/?code=shale14&f=home" target="_hplink">warned</a> that failure to develop shale gas "will have damaging consequences on European energy security and prosperity" and urged European governments to "allow shale gas exploration to advance" so they could "fully understand the scale of the opportunity."<br />
<br />
US lobbying shops also jumped into the fray. Covington & Burling, a major Washington firm, hired several former senior EU policymakers—including a top energy official who, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/world/europe/lobbying-bonanza-as-firms-try-to-influence-european-union.html?pagewanted=all" target="_hplink">according to the <em>New York Times</em></a>, arrived with a not-yet-public draft of the European Commission's fracking regulations.<br />
<br />
In June 2013, Covington staffer Jean De Ruyt, a former Belgian diplomat and adviser to the European Commission, hosted an event at the firm's Brussels office. Executives from Chevron and other oil and gas behemoths attended, as did Kurt Vandenberghe, then one of the commission's top environmental regulators. These strategies appeared to pay off: The commission's recently released framework for regulating fracking includes recommendations for governments but not firm requirements. "They chose the weakest option they had," says Simon of Friends of the Earth Europe. "People at the highest level of the commission are in the industry's pocket."<br />
<br />
Goldwyn was also busy promoting fracking overseas—this time on behalf of industry. Between January and October 2012, his firm organized a series of workshops on fracking for officials in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine, all of them funded by Chevron. The events were closed to the public—when Romanian journalist Vlad Ursulean <a href="http://necir.org/2013/08/05/fracking-the-u-s-romania-connection/" target="_hplink">tried to attend</a> the Romanian gathering, he says Goldwyn personally saw to it that he was escorted out.<br />
<br />
<div style="width:240px; margin:10px; float:left;"><img src="http://www.motherjones.com/files/goldwyn250.jpg" /><p><div style="width:340;font-size:90%;">David Goldwyn at a 2006 NATO conference <em><a href="http://www.nato.int/multi/photos/2006/m061019d.htm" target="_hplink">NATO photos</a></em></div></p></div><br />
<br />
Goldwyn told <em>Mother Jones</em> that the workshops featured presentations on technical aspects of fracking by academics from the Colorado School of Mines and Penn State University. Chevron, he maintains, had "no editorial input." But all of these countries—except Bulgaria, which was in the midst of anti-fracking protests—would later grant Chevron major shale concessions.<br />
<br />
In some cases, the State Department had a direct hand in negotiating the deals. Gitenstein, then the ambassador to Romania, met with Chevron executives and Romanian officials and pressed them to hand over millions of acres of shale concessions. "The Romanians were just sitting on the leases, and Chevron was upset. So I intervened," says Gitenstein, whose State Department tenure has been bookended by stints at Mayer Brown, a law and lobbying firm that has represented Chevron. "This is traditionally what ambassadors do on behalf of American companies." In the end, Romania signed a 30-year deal with Chevron, which helped set off massive, nationwide protests.<br />
<br />
When the government began weighing a fracking ban, it didn't sit well with Gitenstein, who went on Romanian television and warned that, without fracking, the nation could be stuck paying five times what America does for natural gas. He <a href="http://www.nineoclock.ro/gitenstein-contracts-with-chevron-might-expire-due-to-moratorium-on-shale-gas-extraction/" target="_hplink">added</a> that US shale prospectors had "obtained great successes—without consequences for the environment, I dare say." The proposed moratorium soon died.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>A FEW WEEKS LATER,</strong> Chevron was preparing to build its first fracking rig near Pungesti, a tiny farming village in northeastern Romania. According to a <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/documents/1291096-intalnire-guvern-chevron-translated" target="_hplink">memo</a> from the prime minister's office, a Romanian official met with Chevron executives and an embassy-based US Commerce Department employee to craft a PR strategy for the project. They agreed to organize a kickoff event at Victoria Palace in Bucharest. As a spokesman, they would tap Damian Draghici, a charismatic Romanian lawmaker who was a "recognized personality among the Roma minority," which had a "considerable presence" around Chevron's planned drilling sites. "It was really extraordinary—the level of collaboration between these players," says Ursulean, who has written extensively about Chevron's activities in Romania. "It was as if they were all branches of the same company."<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:20px;float:right;margin:20px;width:200px">"The Romanians were just sitting on the leases, and Chevron was upset," says former US ambassador to Romania Mark Gitenstein. "So I intervened."</span><br />
<br />
The strategy did little to soothe the public's ire. When Chevron finally did attempt to install the rig in late 2013, residents—including elderly villagers who arrived in horse-drawn carts—<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/21/chevron-shale-gas-exploration-omanian-pungesti" target="_hplink">blockaded</a> the planned drilling sites. The Romanian Orthodox Church rallied behind them, with one local priest likening Chevron to enemy "invaders." Soon, anti-fracking protests were cropping up from <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/0724/A-Polish-village-says-no-to-fracking" target="_hplink">Poland</a> to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/12/anti-fracking-protests-corporation-interest" target="_hplink">United Kingdom</a>. But Chevron didn't back down. Along with other American energy firms, it lobbied to insert language in a proposed US-EU trade agreement allowing US companies to haul European governments before international arbitration panels for any actions threatening their investments. Chevron <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/documents/1237936-ttip-lobbybrief-chevron" target="_hplink">argued</a> this was necessary to protect shareholders against "arbitrary" and "unfair" treatment by local authorities. But environmental groups say it would stymie fracking regulation and point to a <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2012/11/23/canadian-taxpayers-could-be-on-hook-for-quebec-fracking-decision/?__lsa=b230-fcef" target="_hplink">$250 million lawsuit</a> Delaware-based Lone Pine Resources has filed against the Canadian province of Quebec for temporarily banning fracking near a key source of drinking water. The case hinges on a similar trade provision.<br />
<br />
Despite the public outcry in Europe, the State Department has stayed the course. Clinton's successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, views natural gas as a key part of his push against climate change. Under Kerry, State has ramped up investment in its shale gas initiative and is planning to expand it to 30 more countries, from Cambodia to Papua New Guinea.<br />
<br />
Following the Crimea crisis, the Obama administration has also been pressing Eastern European countries to fast-track their fracking initiatives so as to be less dependent on Russia. During an April visit to Ukraine, which has granted concessions to Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell, Vice President Joe Biden announced that the United States would bring in technical experts to speed up its shale gas development. "We stand ready to assist you," <a href="http://ukraine.usembassy.gov/statements/biden_l-04222014.html" target="_hplink">promised Biden</a>, whose son Hunter has <a href="http://time.com/2964493/ukraine-joe-biden-son-hunter-burisma/" target="_hplink">since joined</a> the board of a Ukrainian energy company. "Imagine where you'd be today if you were able to tell Russia: 'Keep your gas.' It would be a very different world." ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[For a change, the cost of the health insurance you get at work didn't go up much this year.<br />
<br />
The cost of job-based health benefits stayed nearly flat in 2014, according to survey results released Wednesday. This year's figures continue a trend of slow growth in premiums for health insurance provided by employers.<br />
<br />
The average annual premium for a family plan rose 3 percent to $16,834, and the average price for a single worker increased 2 percent to $6,025, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and the American Hospital Association's Health Research and Educational Trust found. Workers on family plans are paying an average 29 percent of that cost, while single employees are paying 18 percent of it. The groups polled <a href="http://www.kff.org/EHBS" target="_hplink">more than 2,000 small and large employers</a> for their report.<br />
<br />
Workers aren't reaping much of a tangible benefit because the cost of job-based health insurance is still increasing faster than wages and overall inflation. But the growth over the last five-year period is much lower than during the two five-year periods preceding it, the survey findings show. From 1999 to 2004, family health plan premiums exploded by a total of 72 percent, followed by a cumulative 34 percent from 2004 to to 2009. Since 2009, these costs have risen 26 percent.<br />

<br />
Despite the recent trend of smaller increases, the cost of employer-sponsored insurance has ballooned over the past 15 years, eating up a larger share of workers' total compensation. Since 1999, the average annual cost of health benefits has nearly tripled.<br />

<br />
The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/03/health-care-spending-2013_n_5759800.html" target="_hplink">historically slow increases in national health spending</a> during recent years contributed to lower premium hikes for employer-sponsored health insurance. But companies also are limiting their health benefit expenses by making workers pick up a bigger share of the monthly premiums and of their medical bills, the survey found. <br />
<br />
High-deductible health plans with lower premiums but greater out-of-pocket costs <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/business/increasingly-high-deductible-health-plans-weigh-down-employees.html" target="_hplink">have become increasingly common</a>. In 2006, just 6 percent of workers were enrolled in these plans, compared to 26 percent in 2011 and 32 percent this year. And the average size of the deductible for a single employee has risen from $584 in 2006 to $1,217 in 2014. Under plans with deductibles, policyholders must spend the full amount of the deductible out of pocket before the insurance coverage kicks in.<br />

<em>Source: <a href="http://www.kff.org/EHBS" target="_hplink">Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation</a></em><br />
<br />
"The relatively low growth in premiums this year is good news for employers and workers, though many workers now pay more when they get sick as deductibles continue to rise and skin-in-the-game insurance gradually becomes the norm," Kaiser Family Foundation President Drew Altman said in a written statement.<br />
<br />
Eighty percent of workers covered with company health benefits have plans with deductibles this year, the survey found. More than 40 percent of covered employees have plans with deductibles of $1,000 or more, and 18 percent of the plans carry deductibles of at least $2,000. Workers at firms with fewer than 100 employees are more likely to face high deductibles than those at larger employers.<br />
<br />
The survey also found that the share of employers that offer health benefits to workers, 55 percent, was about the same this year as last year. Small companies are less likely to provide health insurance, but 90 percent of workers are employed by a company that offers benefits to at least some of its workforce. Eighty percent of employees who have access to job-based health insurance accept it, according to the poll.<br />
<br />
Looking ahead to next year, the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust expect the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to exert greater influence on job-based health insurance. Beginning in 2015, the law requires companies with at least 100 employees <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/white-house-delays-health-insurance-mandate-for-medium-sized-employers-until-2016/2014/02/10/ade6b344-9279-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html" target="_hplink">to offer health benefits</a> to full-time workers, <a href="http://kff.org/infographic/employer-responsibility-under-the-affordable-care-act/" target="_hplink">or pay penalties</a> when employees obtain subsidized coverage via the Obamacare health insurance exchanges. In 2016, that employer mandate will extend to companies with 50 or more workers.<br />
<br />
"The relatively quiet period in 2014 may give way to bigger changes in 2015 as the employer shared-responsibility provision in the ACA takes effect for large employers," the report says.<br />
<br />
According to survey findings released last month by the National Business Group on Health, premiums for job-based coverage at large companies <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/employer-health-insurance_n_5673039.html" target="_hplink">will rise 5 percent next year</a>, and more employers will offer only plans with high deductibles. These companies expect the ACA to have only a modest effect on 2015 health benefit costs, the poll found. ]]></description>

      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2014 09:55:43 -0400</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[You might not know it, but the reason you're able to read this article, the reason you found out about happened in Ferguson when you did and how you did, the reason you're able to participate in activism on the Internet, is because of the way the Internet has worked since its inception -- as an open platform free from corporate censorship and free from discrimination by gatekeepers at the network level.<br />
<br />
This open nature of the Internet is again under attack, and it was years ago, with the corporate players behind the push using key voices in our community to further their interests, while at the same time undermining ours.<br />
<br />
I actually thought this would be an old story given the sunlight that was shown four years ago during the 2010 Open Internet proceedings at the FCC. On display were the connections between civil rights organizations (like the NAACP, LULAC, National Urban League) who received significant funding from the big telecom players like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon, and their policy positions favoring those companies.<br />
<br />
But I guess four years is long time: long enough for some folks to forget, and long enough for the people and organizations implicated to brazenly go on <a href="http://bit.ly/1mRcZgd" target="_hplink">offense</a>.<br />
<br />
David Honig, as I explained four years ago, is the man behind the curtain when it comes to civil rights organizations lining up behind telecom-friendly positions. David, and the organizations he has organized, are again advocating for fast and slow lanes on the Internet, a position that puts them in line with the interest of the large ISPs (Internet Service Providers), and in opposition to the communities they claim to serve.<br />
<br />
While most of you have probably never heard of David, there is no more significant player in DC when it comes to telecom policy and the major civil rights organizations in this country. And the FCC Chairman, Tom Wheeler, who is leading the commission in determining the fate of the Internet, has treated David and his organization as <a href="http://bit.ly/XnjguA" target="_hplink">legitimate</a>.<br />
<br />
As reporters recently began calling out the connections between his organization, MMTC (Minority Media and Telecommunications Council), civil rights groups, the telecom money they all receive, and their surprising policy positions, David responded by calling the reporting outrageous, insulting, and racist -- calling those pointing out the relationships a "digital lynch mob."<br />
<br />
David then engaged Field Negro, a political blogger to <a href="http://bit.ly/1pxhzFk" target="_hplink">express his supposed outrage</a>. Below is the letter I wrote to the blog in response, which Field Negro thankfully printed, in hopes of connecting the dots for those who have been confused (or misled). My goal in reprinting here is not only to dispel the false narrative being put forth by Honig, it's to shine a light on the greater dynamics in play around the deployment of our civil rights organizations in support of a corporate agenda that is not in line with the interests of our community. Here is the letter:<br />
<br />
<center>_______</center><br />
<br />
<br />
Hello Field,<br />
<br />
Thank you for allowing me to respond to a statement made by David Honig of the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council that you published last week.<br />
<br />
In David's statement, he attacked anyone who questioned the influence telecom money has had on the position his organization and other civil rights groups have taken against Net Neutrality, a position that aligns these groups with efforts by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T to undermine an open Internet. But he goes further than that. He says it's insulting -- even racist -- to ask the questions being posed.<br />
<br />
In reality, and David knows this, the circuit of which he is a part is awash in telecom and cable industry money, and all too often the voices of organizations that take industry money end up being aligned with policy positions that benefit the companies providing the money.<br />
<br />
If David acknowledged that this dynamic exists, but disclosed who his backers are in a forthright manner and argued that he himself, his organization, and the civil rights organizations he's organized were an exception to the dynamic, he might have some credibility. Instead, he pretends like this dynamic doesn't exist; according to the Center for Public Integrity, he's been elusive about the millions he's <a href="http://bit.ly/X3hM8I" target="_hplink">taken from lobbyists, lawyers, and companies with business interests</a> before the FCC; and instead of leading with an argument about how he's right, he (a white guy) accuses those shining a light on these issues of being racist.<br />
<br />
<strong>Background</strong><br />
<br />
First, I want to acknowledge that I know David. Four years ago when I was the executive director of ColorOfChange, I researched the current state of the issue of Net Neutrality in depth (I understood it in the past, given my background as a software developer and architect, and from advocacy work I'd done on the issue in 2006), and ultimately ran a <a href="http://bit.ly/1kol5Bw" target="_hplink">campaign</a> that sought to expose the dynamics coming under scrutiny: civil rights groups (knowingly or not knowingly) taking policy positions that benefit their corporate backers, instead of the communities they represent. As part of the process, I met with David and also talked with the leadership of NAACP, LULAC, NCBCP and other organizations -- the context was the previous Net Neutrality proceeding before the FCC at the time.<br />
<br />
This current debate is an escalation of that previous debate. Back then David organized several civil rights groups to sign onto comments that opposed Net Neutrality, including many of the core organizations currently opposing open Internet protections this time around.<br />
<br />
At the time, <strong>Honig and other civil rights groups argued they support most open Internet protections but <a href="http://bit.ly/1yfn10j" target="_hplink">opposed</a> efforts that would ban ISPs from discriminating online (see p.15 of their filing)</strong> -- i.e. allowing pay-for play fast lanes vs. slow lanes, the prevention of which is a central element of Net Neutrality -- because they claim it would hurt low income households. It could have the unintended consequences, they argued, of preventing ISPs from investing in broadband in poor communities. In other words, ISPs would invest in Black communities if they could make more money by discriminating online. It's a theory of trickle-down economics that has been <a href="http://bit.ly/X6G1mD" target="_hplink">debunked</a> repeatedly.<br />
<br />
The position MMTC and other civil rights groups staked out at the time perfectly matched the rhetoric and goals of the major ISPs who have backed them. And despite asking, I never heard David, the civil rights groups, or any of the front groups who've pushed these messages, succeed in making a cogent argument to back up their conclusions about how eliminating Net Neutrality would actually result in investment in the communities about which they purportedly care. Four years later, the groups are again making the same arguments, again right in line with the messaging and goals of AT&T, Verizon and Comcast.<br />
<br />
<strong>Talking with the FCC and Hill staff</strong><br />
<br />
Over the years, I've talked with commissioners from the FCC, members of Congress, and their respective staff. There was a time when I thought it was important to explain how the arguments being peddled by groups like MMTC and the major civil rights groups didn't hold water -- that they were essentially vacuous arguments that happened to be in service of the interests of the ISPs. I quickly learned that those on the inside -- whether on Capitol Hill, at the FCC, or on K Street -- knew this. I was told that it wasn't about substance of the arguments; it was about the messenger. Groups like the NAACP, National Urban League, LULAC and others, placed enormous political pressure on the FCC by aligning themselves with the telecom companies. The FCC -- especially under Democratic control -- doesn't want to be seen as going against the wishes of minority groups. And this is why the <a href="http://bit.ly/1otekz8" target="_hplink">approach the telecom industry uses</a> is so effective.<br />
<br />
A few weeks ago, I sat down with Tom Wheeler, the current FCC chair, when he visited the Bay Area. When I brought up the dynamic described above -- with civil rights groups carrying the trickle-down economics argument of the ISPs -- he acknowledged it to be a time-tested tactic, even cracking a joke about the sleight of hand being used by the ISPs to have others carry their water.<br />
<br />
<strong>The greater dynamic in play</strong><br />
<br />
David and MMTC are not alone -- they are a part of much larger ecosystem. <a href="http://bit.ly/1AXJ9jM" target="_hplink">Hispanic Technology and Telecommunications Partnership (HTTP)</a> has organized civil rights groups in the same manner, but with an emphasis on the <a href="http://ti.me/1sARWn3" target="_hplink">Latino community</a>. There are telecom industry consultants and lobbyists who serve on the boards of civil rights organizations and have <a href="http://bit.ly/1pYrxf1" target="_hplink">been shown</a> to use their position to influence. There are media figures that are actually paid by the corporations whose messages they repeat, while not disclosing their connection -- just this week, Kristal High, the founder and editor in chief of Politics365, a major MMTC apologist who has <a href="http://bit.ly/1muaIaH" target="_hplink">trolled the comments section</a> of articles supporting the preservation of Net Neutrality, was <a href="http://bit.ly/1vf89mc" target="_hplink">exposed</a> for being paid by the ISPs, without disclosing this fact. There are industry front groups (often called astro-turf groups) like <a href="http://bit.ly/1oIEr2U" target="_hplink">Broadband for America </a>-- claiming to be community-based and committed to achieving broadband access for communities of color, but in reality they are funded by telecom industry giants and are used to build grassroots support for policies friendly to them.<br />
<br />
And, finally, there are paid lobbying firms that are used to go deep into our communities to gin up support for the position of the large telecom players, using the voice of local and state civil rights leaders (this I know because I was approached by a member of a DC lobbying firm that was paid to do this and personally carried out the work). Just search the FCC docket from four years ago for comments filed by MMTC, HTTP, and the organizations they represent, and you'll see the same message being repeated. You'll also see state and local NAACP and Urban League chapters repeating the same industry talking points, deployed by and fed language by DC advocacy firms that specialize in the quid pro quo exchange of money for policy support. So much for free-thinking and independent groups, as David likes to claim.<br />
<br />
While this dynamic is understood by those working in the beltway, people outside of Washington remain largely unaware of the relationship between civil rights organizations and the interests of telecom industry players. That began to change in 2011 when Jarrett Barrios, the head of GLAAD, was <a href="http://huff.to/X3nSG1" target="_hplink">forced to step down</a> after the LGBT media exposed that the organization was influenced by an AT&T board member to support the AT&T-T-Mobile merger. It was also revealed that the AT&T board member got GLAAD to send a letter opposing Net Neutrality the previous year.<br />
<br />
This scandal, for a moment, helped push the conversation about civil rights organizations and telecom companies outside the beltway, with the <em>New York Times</em> editorial page <a href="http://nyti.ms/1tZB0JO" target="_hplink">talking about</a> GLAAD, the NAACP, and other civil rights organizations defending policy positions with weak arguments, while receiving big dollars from the companies that stand to benefit.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why this matters</strong><br />
<br />
Before finishing, I wanted to say a bit about why Net Neutrality is important to low-income communities, and in particular communities of color. Over the course of history, each new medium to arrive has had the potential to enable everyday people to push back on power, to produce and distribute authentic messages coming from our communities, undisturbed by a corporate filter. And each has repeatedly been killed. For each medium -- radio, television, and print -- there was the promise of people-controlled media. Yet through media consolidation and barriers-to-entry created by larger corporations to prevent new players from entering, the promise was undone.<br />
<br />
The Internet, thus far, has escaped the fate of these other media, largely because of Net Neutrality, which has governed the way content on the Internet is managed. Changing this is in the financial interest of the biggest ISPs (like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon), but it offers no benefit to consumers.<br />
<br />
In the current Internet, Field Negro can say what he wants, ColorOfChange can knock media figures like Glenn Beck off a major network, and upstart news organizations can come in and challenge major incumbents -- because corporate filters and roadblocks haven't been a part of the landscape when it comes to the core design of the Internet. Similarly, all traffic is prioritized equally -- there are no slow lanes for content and application providers without a lot of money, and fast lanes for those with deep pockets who can afford to pay.<br />
<br />
The courts have made clear that reclassifying broadband under Title II of the 1996 Telecommunications Act is the only way in the current regulatory landscape for the FCC to be on solid ground in attempting to exercise its authority to protect Net Neutrality rules.<br />
<br />
Unlike four years ago, the major ISPs, as well as those repeating their arguments like MMTC, have moved away from straight-up opposing Net Neutrality. Now they say they're for it, but that Section 706 of the Act should be used instead of reclassification under Title II. The problem is that the courts have <a href="http://bit.ly/1skwKUE" target="_hplink">twice struck down</a> the ability of the FCC to use that path for protecting the Internet, preventing fast lanes for those that can pay and slow lanes for those that can't. And that's the problem with the position of MMTC and the major civil rights groups. They now claim that they support Net Neutrality, but history shows it's likely to be meaningless without reclassification, and that relying on Section 706 cannot stop pay for play. Anyone who has studied the issue, presumably including David Honig, MMTC, and the civil rights organizations he's organized, understands that.<br />
<br />
I think it's fine for corporations to advocate for policies that benefit them -- it's their job. However, it's the job of organizations that represent our communities to do just that -- represent our communities, not the interests of corporations with which they're financially aligned. These organizations, and the moral authority they claim to have (and should have) cannot be for sale.<br />
<br />
The recent <a href="http://huff.to/1uLiUN5" target="_hplink">rash of articles</a> to which Honig objects serve to strengthen our institutions by ensuring they're accountable. Shedding light on the dynamics in play -- dynamics that have the ability to undermine the integrity of our institutions, leaders, and messengers -- is critical, because in the end it is our community that is harmed by a lack of accountable leadership. It's why the presence of these articles is a great thing. And that's why David's response to the criticism he has received -- that it's insulting, even racist for anyone to raise questions about MMTC's or other civil rights organizations' behavior as described above -- lacks credibility and falls flat.<br />

      <description><![CDATA[PITTSBURGH (AP) — A Pennsylvania county council has voted 8-6 against posting the national motto, "In God We Trust," in its chambers.<br />
<br />
Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald had threatened to veto the measure, which he called "a movement by the right-wing evangelical Christians across the country basically to impose Christianity" in public buildings. Fitzgerald is a Democrat, as are the eight council members who opposed the display, which would also have included Pennsylvania's state motto "Virtue, Liberty and Independence" and another U.S. motto, "E Pluribus Unum."<br />
<br />
All five Republicans on council voted for the display, as did Democrat Bill Robinson.<br />
<br />
A Democrat who co-sponsored the bill, Councilman Charles Martoni, voted against it saying, "The more I looked at it, it's unnecessary." Another Democrat co-sponsor, Councilman John Palmiere, didn't attend Tuesday's meeting. Council has 15 members.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Rachel Maddow delivered a powerful monologue Tuesday night about the American plan to intervene in Iraq and Syria to combat the militant Islamic State group.<br />
<br />
Maddow said that the situation is "starting to look like an Iraq war," with the Obama administration launching its 153rd airstrike on Tuesday. Maddow pointed out that the nation is currently split over how to intervene-- with some Americans supporting airstrikes and others supporting the use of combat troops. The problem with that, she said, is that the outcome of any kind of intervention could be both. <br />
<br />
"It may be very convenient to say you support airstrikes, but not combat, or to say you support airstrikes, but not boots on the ground," Maddow said. "But there already are more than 1100 US personnel in Iraq to support the airstrikes that are already happening. God forbid, if American aircraft start to get shot down by this militant group with their anti-aircraft artillery, then you better believe there are going to be boots on the ground and very quickly."<br />
<br />
Maddow urged--demanded-- that Congress "start earning their salaries" and debate this issue immediately to come up with a concrete, strategic plan before history repeats itself.<br />
<br />
"We have a great and recent history of making terrible decisions," she said forcefully. "Terrible, short-sided, poorly argued and in some cases based on false premises decisions."<br />

      <description><![CDATA[If you don't want to get probed, poked, pinched, tasered, tackled, searched, seized, stripped, manhandled, arrested, shot, or killed, don't say, do or even suggest anything that even hints of noncompliance. This is the new "thin blue line" over which you must not cross in interactions with police if you want to walk away with your life and freedoms intact.<br />
<br />
The following incidents and many more like them serve as chilling reminders that in the American police state, "we the people" are at the mercy of law enforcement officers who have almost absolute discretion to decide who is a threat, what constitutes resistance, and how harshly they can deal with the citizens they were appointed to "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/opinion/the-mayor-the-police-and-eric-garner.html?_r=0" target="_hplink">serve and protect.</a>"<br />
<br />
For example, police arrested Chaumtoli Huq because she failed to promptly comply when ordered to "move along" while waiting outside a Ruby Tuesday's restaurant for her children, who were inside with their father, using the bathroom. NYPD officers grabbed Huq, a lawyer with the New York City Public Advocate's office, flipped her around, pressed her against a wall, handcuffed her, searched her purse, arrested her, and told her to "shut up" when she cried out for help, before <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/09/04/nyc-cops-arrest-human-rights-lawyer-waiting-outside-restaurant-while-her-kids-used-restroom/?onswipe_redirect=no&oswrr=1" target="_hplink">detaining her for nine hours</a>. Huq was charged with <a href="http://rt.com/usa/185596-lawyer-sues-nypd-muslim" target="_hplink">obstructing governmental administration, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct</a>.<br />
<br />
Oregon resident Fred Marlow was <a href="http://photographyisnotacrime.com/2014/09/08/oregon-man-arrested-recording-militarized-police-raid-neighborhood" target="_hplink">jailed and charged with interfering and resisting arrest</a> after he filmed a SWAT team raid that took place across the street from his apartment and uploaded the footage to the internet. The <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/08/man-was-recording-militarized-swat-raid-when-things-took-a-sudden-turn-at-first-i-was-scared-to-post-this-video" target="_hplink">footage</a> shows police officers threatening Marlow, who was awoken by the sounds of "multiple bombs blasting and glass breaking" and ran outside to investigate only to be threatened with arrest if he didn't follow orders and return inside.<br />
<br />
Marine Brandon Raub was questioned at his home by a swarm of DHS, FBI, Secret Service agents and local police, tackled to the ground, handcuffed, and forcibly transported to a police station. Raub was then detained against his will in a psychiatric ward, without being provided any explanation, having any charges levied against him or being read his rights--all allegedly because of controversial song lyrics and political views posted on his Facebook page. <br />
<br />
Incredibly, police insisted that Raub was not in fact under arrest. Of course, Raub <em>was </em>under arrest. When your hands are handcuffed behind you, when armed policemen are tackling you to the ground and transporting you across town in the back of a police car, and then forcibly detaining you against your will, you're not free to walk away. <br />
<br />
If you do attempt to walk away, be warned that the consequences will likely be even worse. <br />
<br />
Miami-Dade police slammed 14-year-old <a href="http://miami.cbslocal.com/2013/05/28/teen-says-police-overreacted-to-incident" target="_hplink">Tremaine McMillian</a> to the ground, putting him in a chokehold and handcuffing him after he allegedly gave them "dehumanizing stares" and walked away from them, which the officers found unacceptable. According to Miami-Dade Police Detective Alvaro Zabaleta, "His body language was that he was stiffening up and pulling away... When you have somebody resistant to them and pulling away and somebody clenching their fists and flailing their arms, that's a threat. <a href="http://miami.cbslocal.com/2013/05/28/teen-says-police-overreacted-to-incident" target="_hplink">Of course we have to neutralize the threat</a>."<br />
<br />
As I point out in my book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Government-Wolves-Emerging-American-Police/dp/1590799755/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370275802&sr=8-1&keywords=a+government+of+wolves+the+emerging+american+police+state" target="_hplink">A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State</a></em>, this mindset that any challenge to police authority is a threat that needs to be "neutralized" is a dangerous one that is part of a greater nationwide trend that sets the police beyond the reach of the Fourth Amendment. Moreover, when police officers are allowed to operate under the assumption that their word is law and that there is no room for any form of disagreement or even question, that serves to chill the First Amendment's assurances of free speech, free assembly and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.<br />
<br />
Frankly, it doesn't matter whether it's a casual "show your ID" request on a boardwalk, a stop-and-frisk search on a city street, or a traffic stop for speeding or just to check your insurance: if you feel like you can't walk away from a police encounter of your own volition -- and more often than not you can't, especially when you're being confronted by someone armed to the hilt with all manner of militarized weaponry and gear -- then for all intents and purposes, you're under arrest from the moment a cop stops you.<br />
<br />
That raises the question, what exactly constitutes resisting an arrest? Do Americans really have any recourse at all when it comes to obeying an order from a police officer, even if it's just to ask a question or assert one's rights, or should we just "surrender quietly"? <br />
<br />
The short answer is that anything short of compliance will get you arrested and jailed. The key word, of course, is <em>comply </em>meaning to obey, submit or conform. <br />
<br />
Clearly, when police officers cease to look and act like civil servants or peace officers but instead look and act like soldiers occupying a hostile territory, it alters their perception of "we the people." <br />
<br />
If daring to question, challenge or even hesitate when a cop issues an order can get you charged with resisting arrest or disorderly conduct, you're not the master in a master-servant relationship. In fact, you're not even the servant -- you're the slave.<br />
<br />
This is not freedom. This is not even a life. <br />
<br />
This is a battlefield, a war zone -- if you will -- governed by martial law and disguised as a democracy. No matter how many ways you fancy it up with shopping malls, populist elections, and Monday night football, the fact remains that "we the people" are little more than prisoners in the American police state, and the police are our jailers and wardens. ]]></description>

      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2014 09:30:45 -0400</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[Secretary of State John Kerry pledged in a <em>New York Times</em> op-ed last week to confront ISIS by assembling a "global coalition using political, humanitarian, economic, law enforcement and intelligence tools." An immediate step for the global coalition in fighting these terrifying and brutal extremists is cutting off their sources of funding.  ISIS rakes in millions each month from its seizure of profitable oil fields, robbing banks and kidnapping innocent victims, to emerge as one of the best financed terrorist organizations in history. A critical element of instilling terror in its enemies as well as raising funds has been an active campaign by ISIS of cultural racketeering, the theft and sale of heritage material for profit.<br />
<br />
As Kerry meets with his international counterparts, protection of cultural heritage should also be on the agenda of his coalition building efforts.<br />
<br />
While often quoted since the release of the movie, <em>The Monuments Men</em>, there is still truth in the adage  "If you destroy an entire generation of people's culture, it's as if they never existed."  Part of ISIS's campaign of terror is to erase those cultures not in line with its extremist views of Islam. On September 2, Amnesty International released a report that says that ISIS is carrying out a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing in Iraq, with this cultural eradication extending to the destruction of sites and cultural material. As ISIS swarmed through Mosul, Iraq's second largest city where Muslims and Christians have coexisted for centuries, it destroyed over forty-five Christian sites.  ISIS was strategic in its targets of destruction -- hitting at sites symbolic of the early years of Christianity, including the Tomb of Jonah, who is famous for surviving being swallowed by the whale.  Jonah's story is repeated in the Quran, and, ironically, his tomb was converted to a mosque. But that did not save it from destruction.  <br />
<br />
It is not just Christian sites under attack.  ISIS seeks to obliterate any culture that does not share its extremist views of Islam.  Sunni and Sufi shrines have been looted and bulldozed to dust.  Sacred Shiite mosques and other revered ancient sites are being destroyed, obliterated by dynamite.  It is an obvious form of cultural terrorism as ISIS threatens anyone under its rule to convert, leave or be put to death.  <br />
<br />
Antiquities theft is another form of cultural terrorism and an important source of revenue for ISIS as well.  ISIS netted up to $36 million from looted antiquities in just one area of Syria alone, according to The Guardian. And Syrian experts say that ISIS has a diabolical strategy for diverting stolen antiquities to fund its cause.  Areas rich in ancient history -- the "cradle of civilization" --  are under its control. ISIS is driving illicit excavations and promising to share the finds in the form of a 20-50 percent tax on the total value, as described in an op-ed in the <em>New York Times</em>. And it is controlling the safe passage of these antiquities to the borders, often using Turkey as the consolidation point, where they are then shipped off to Europe, the United States and Asia.<br />
<br />
Just last year, imports of legally declared Syrian antiquities to the United States rose almost 1300 percent.  Illicit shipments are no doubt significantly higher. International leaders who condemn the destruction of these sites as part of the public comments about ISIS will give strength -- and cover -- to the thousands of brave men and women seeking to protect their heritage, often at great risk to their own lives.<br />
<br />
Secretary Kerry has a platform for taking action -- both in building this international coalition to fight against ISIS and in his role as Secretary of State. Domestically, he has the authority to direct U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to halt the import of antiquities from Syria and Iraq. The British government has just taken a similar action to block the import of antiquities from Syria.  The United States and the United Kingdom have the largest markets for antiquities, so limiting both the access -- as well as requesting extra vigilance from the auction houses and the antiquities retailers -- will have an important impact.<br />
<br />
Decisive action by the international community to prevent further cultural terrorism and profiteering from antiquities theft will advance the fight against ISIS. As Secretary Kerry builds his International Coalition, he will no doubt include the "demand" side countries that are receiving looted antiquities as well as many of the "supply" side countries where antiquities looting threatens our shared heritage. <br />
<br />
"Airstrikes alone won't defeat this enemy. A much fuller response is demanded from the world," writes the Secretary. "We need to disrupt and degrade ISIS' capabilities." Ending the scourge of ISIS's reign of cultural terrorism would provide that disruption. This is an outcome that the international coalition should vigorously pursue - and accomplish.<br />

      <description><![CDATA[Australia is known to many people for its sunshine and sporting prowess. But every so often rain stops play.<br />
<br />
As a great sporting nation, Australia shows that the rules of fair play govern cricket pitches and the uniquely Australian ovals that host the national football code, Australian Rules. <br />
<br />
As G20 labor ministers gathered at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground, a wall of torrential thunderstorms and flash flooding hit the city. <br />
<br />
And rain nearly stopped play.<br />
<br />
<center><a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-10-20140909_191605.jpg"><img alt="2014-09-10-20140909_191605.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-10-20140909_191605-thumb.jpg" width="570" height="427" /></a></center><br />
<br />
The challenge for <a href="https://www.g20.org/" target="_hplink">Australia's presidency of the G20</a> is to see co-ordinated action on the global economic playing field.  <br />
<br />
The Australian G20 season is entering its final few months.  G20 leaders are preparing to gather for their very own grand final in November at the G20 leaders' summit in Brisbane.  And it looks like we're heading for a nail-biting finish.<br />
<br />
The Australian government has taken to its player-manager role heading up the G20, a team of 20 political leaders from the world's largest economies. <br />
<br />
G20 Finance Ministers, the iron-fisted coaches of the G20 leaders, have set a<a href="http://theconversation.com/g20-finance-ministers-agree-to-growth-target-experts-react-23566" target="_hplink"> target of 2 percent growth</a> above trajectory.<br />
<br />
G20 Labor Ministers, the team nutritionists for the global economy, have a chance to give the leaders a plan to grow the global economy with jobs and a decent pay packet.<br />
<br />
Like fans and players alike, we all know our team's statistics: <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/media-centre/press-releases/WCMS_305429/lang--en/index.htm" target="_hplink">100 million people unemployed in G20 </a>countries, falling demand, stagnating wages and rising inequality.<br />
<br />
But the challenge is to get the G20 team to work together and see co-ordinated action on the field.<br />
<br />
There are some big questions that need to be addressed in the locker room of the next G20 team talk in November.<br />
<br />
Growing inequality and a worldwide slump in wages are the divets on the field -- which cause pain and collapsing economies to players running at high speed.<br />
<br />
Wage growth has significantly lagged behind productivity growth in most G20 countries, while wage and income inequality either remains high or has widened.<br />
<br />
This game plan will see the current jobs gap widen from 2008 to <a href="http://www.ituc-csi.org/slump-in-wages-put-g20-labour" target="_hplink">81 million</a> global jobs by 2018. <br />
<br />
Workers and fans won't be waving from the stands to support the G20 team on this basis. Most can't afford the price of a ticket for the game.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ituc-csi.org/ituc-global-poll-2014" target="_hplink">More than one in two working families</a> in 14 countries that constitute half the world's population cannot keep up with the rising cost of living.<br />
<br />
Real wages have stagnated, or even fallen, for many in advanced G20 economies.  <br />
<br />
The 2014 season has given us 100 million unemployed and a <a href="http://www.ituc-csi.org/slump-in-wages-put-g20-labour" target="_hplink">62-million-jobs gap in G20</a> countries alone. There is an urgent need to intervene to create both jobs and increase wages.<br />
<br />
There is an alternative game plan.<br />
<br />
A team strategy for the G20 with investment in infrastructure and increase in wages that would see the jobs gap in G20 countries halved with the <a href="http://www.ituc-csi.org/the-case-for-a-coordinated-policy" target="_hplink">creation of around 33 million jobs</a>, the wage share increased along with demand and growth secured. <br />
<br />
As every team knows: You're only as strong as your weakest player.<br />
<br />
Every one percentage point simultaneous decline in the wage share in the world leads to a <a href="http://www.ituc-csi.org/the-case-for-a-coordinated-policy" target="_hplink">decline</a> in the global GDP by 0.36 percentage points.<br />
<br />
In the last three decades, <a href="http://www.ituc-csi.org/l20-trade-union-statement-to-the" target="_hplink">wages have slumped</a> by nearly 10 percent. <br />
<br />
That's where Labor 20 economic modeling comes in, with a new game plan. It shows a coordinated mix of wage and investment policies in G20 countries can <a href="http://www.ituc-csi.org/the-case-for-a-coordinated-policy" target="_hplink">create up to 5.84 percent more growth</a> in G20 countries -- compared to business as usual.  <br />
<br />
Investment in jobs, wages and social protection is the answer to reduce inequality, increase demand and drive growth.<br />
<br />
G20 Labor leaders have the game plan. <br />
<br />
There are no more excuses to action. For millions of workers around the world, rain must not stop play. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In a move that will surprise very few, former White House press secretary Jay Carney has <a href="https://twitter.com/vplus/status/509691961067192320" target="_hplink">joined CNN</a> as a contributor.<br />
<br />
Carney, who was a veteran journalist before joining the Obama administration, will <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/09/jay-carney-joins-cnn-195215.html" target="_hplink">start Wednesday night</a>, just as the president makes a major address about ISIS.<br />
<br />
He is one of a string of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/12/robert-gibbs-msnbc-contributor_n_2673865.html" target="_hplink">Obama officials</a> to get jobs in the media once they leave the White House.<br />
<br />
Carney's move into punditry was widely assumed; a New York Times interviewer once <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/magazine/jay-carney.html?_r=1" target="_hplink">asked</a> him, "Now that you’re leaving your job as White House press secretary, do you know which cable news network you’re going to be a pundit for?" ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The homeless population in Denver now has an abundance of life-changing resources available for them to access. And each one is under one (very large) roof.<br />
<br />
A first-of-its-kind, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26493985/coalition-homeless-opens-new-health-care-facility-denver" target="_hplink">53,192-square-foot facility</a> opened this week in the Mile High City, providing both housing and a multitude of health care services to the area's homeless population, according to The Denver Post. About three times as many examine rooms exist in the new Stout Street Health Center than in an older facility utilized by the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, with medical and dental offices, an eye clinic and substance treatment services resting below <a href="http://www.coloradocoalition.org/what_we_do/healthcare.aspx" target="_hplink">78 brand new apartments</a> that have already been filled with formerly homeless residents. <br />
<br />
<img alt="denver homeless" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2041890/thumbs/o-DENVER-HOMELESS-570.jpg?5" /><br />
<br />
<img alt="denver homeless" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2041902/thumbs/o-DENVER-HOMELESS-570.jpg?2" /><br />
<br />
John Parvensky, president of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, told The Denver Post that the health center is <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26493985/coalition-homeless-opens-new-health-care-facility-denver" target="_hplink">"the most advanced integration of mental and physical health care in the country for the homeless or anyone else."</a><br />
<br />
<img alt="denver homeless" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2041896/thumbs/o-DENVER-HOMELESS-570.jpg?1" /><br />
<br />
Even former President Bill Clinton is excited about what the facility means for Denver's most vulnerable residents. He visited the center while it was still under construction in June, saying he was <a href="http://www.9news.com/story/news/local/2014/09/09/homeless-care-facility-opens/15321813/" target="_hplink">"very impressed"</a> with what he saw, according to NBC 9 News.<br />
<br />
<img alt="denver homeless" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2041886/thumbs/o-DENVER-HOMELESS-570.jpg?1" /><br />
<br />
The coalition had lobbied to construct the <a href="http://www.9news.com/story/news/local/2014/09/09/homeless-care-facility-opens/15321813/" target="_hplink">$35 million facility</a> with help from city, state, federal and private funds. Stout Street Health Center will be able to continue operation because of federal reimbursements made possible through the Affordable Care Act, as the legislation dramatically increased the number of homeless patients who qualify for Medicaid: This year, <a href="http://www.9news.com/story/news/local/2014/09/09/homeless-care-facility-opens/15321813/" target="_hplink">65 percent</a> of those serviced by the coalition were medically insured, as opposed to just 15 percent before Obamacare took effect, Parvensky told NBC 9 News. <br />
<br />
Last year, the coalition provided health care services to <a href="http://www.coloradocoalition.org/what_we_do/healthcare.aspx" target="_hplink">13,323 men, women and children</a> of all ages, accoring to the organization's website. Because of the expansion of space and services, however, Parvensky said the health center will be able to serve <a href="http://www.9news.com/story/news/local/2014/09/09/homeless-care-facility-opens/15321813/" target="_hplink">50 percent</a> more people -- a crucial improvement, as up to <a href="http://www.9news.com/story/news/local/2014/09/09/homeless-care-facility-opens/15321813/" target="_hplink">2,000 people</a> had been on the waiting list for mental health services alone at the old facility.<br />
<br />
<img alt="denver homeless" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2041912/thumbs/o-DENVER-HOMELESS-570.jpg?3" /><br />
<br />
<img alt="denver homeless" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2041908/thumbs/o-DENVER-HOMELESS-570.jpg?1" /><br />
<br />
And concerned taxpayers need not fret: The center is expected to reduce both state and local costs for emergency health care, detox and other services by <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26493985/coalition-homeless-opens-new-health-care-facility-denver" target="_hplink">30 percent</a> each year, Parvensky told The Denver Post.<br />
<br />
<img alt="denver homeless" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2041922/thumbs/o-DENVER-HOMELESS-570.jpg?1" /><br />
<br />
Bobbie Vaughs, who had been homeless for about a year prior to securing her new apartment above the facility, said the people who made the health center possible have transformed her life. <br />
<br />
"Without them," she told NBC 9 News. <a href="http://www.9news.com/story/news/local/2014/09/09/homeless-care-facility-opens/15321813/" target="_hplink">"I don't know where I would be."</a><br />

      <description><![CDATA[Michigan's primary elections were last month and for a young progressive who loves all things political, it was Christmas in August for me. <br />
<br />
As a member of LaunchProgress PAC's Candidate Advisory Board, I was excited to support our Michigan candidates Jon Hoadley, Stephanie Chang, and Kristy Pagan who won big on August 5, and Rebecca Thompson, a strong LaunchProgress candidate who was just 500 votes shy of winning her election.<br />
<br />
But still, I'm haunted by the text message I received the afternoon of the primary, "Today are elections? Wasn't Obama just re-elected?"<br />
<br />
Sadly this is the reality our country lives in. Many Americans, young and old, do not pay attention to local or state elections. Less than 18 percent of registered voters cast a ballot in Michigan's primary this year. This is astonishing considering the impact these "small" elections have on people's lives. <br />
<br />
One example is the death of Trayvon Martin in Florida, an innocent young, black man who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, who was later acquitted due a Florida law called "Stand Your Ground." Many are familiar with George Zimmerman and blame him for this crime. But most don't know Dennis Baxley, for instance, the Florida state representative who co-sponsored the "Stand Your Ground" legislation and ushered this bill into law in the first place. <br />
<br />
Another example is a recent law in Michigan called "Rape Insurance" that forces women to get separate insurance in case they are raped, absurdly placing the burden and blame on the rape survivor. Should all women expect or presume to be raped in their lifetime? The bill does not specify, but you could ask bill sponsor, State Rep. Mike Shirkey, who was first elected to the State House in November 2011. If you did not vote in Michigan's primary election, you may have missed the opportunity to remove Shirkey from office -- he won Tuesday and will be on the November ballot for State Senate. <br />
<br />
Politics can be taboo in our daily lives. It can leave a bad taste in our mouths. But we cannot continue to only engage on an issue once it produces an outcome we don't like. We need to engage early to prevent an unfortunate outcome.<br />
<br />
The greatest thing about this country is, as citizens, we have the right to choose our representatives. It's a gift to have the ability to cast our vote for the candidate we believe in, one many Americans take for granted. So the next time someone says, "I don't vote because my one vote doesn't matter," a common answer I hear when I ask someone why they don't vote in elections, tell them that's just plain wrong. Tell them about Trayvon Martin and the "Stand Your Ground" law state legislators in Florida passed. Tell them about the Michigan rape insurance law that the state legislature advanced. <br />
<br />
Then there's the death of Mike Brown. Emotions and tensions are running high because of the murder of 18-year-old Brown by a police officer. Get upset about what's going on. Embrace that anger and rage inside you. Now channel that anger to do something positive. Get involved in elections and vote for candidates who will stand up proudly against the injustice of police brutality. <br />
<br />
We have to remember that we elect the people who will change the laws that affect us, for better or for worse. It's time for us to get invested in state and local governments and elect people who make real change in our community and in our lives. <br />
<br />
I know what you're thinking, "a millennial is telling me to vote?" Why, yes one is. I know a large amount of people believe millennials are the 'lost generation' and there's no hope for the future. Some say us millennials will never get serious about it. I've even heard that we'll be the reason for the end of the world. (Thanks for the confidence booster.)<br />
<br />
However, I know my generation. Call me a delusional dreamer, but I strongly believe in my generation. We will exceed expectations and bring about positive change in this country, and this world.<br />
<br />
Electing someone into public office is a serious responsibility. It is time for my generation to recognize this responsibility by supporting and electing young people who are running for office. They understand the problems we face and have the energy to fight for the causes we believe in.<br />

      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON (AP) — Women's colleges are revisiting policies around enrolling transgender students as institutions of higher learning — single-sex, coed and those with religious affiliations — demonstrate varying degrees of acceptance for changing norms.<br />
<br />
Mills College in Oakland, California, recently became the first women's college in the U.S. to declare it would accept undergraduate applications from "self-identified women" and people "assigned female at birth who do not fit into the gender binary," effective the semester that starts January 2015. Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, followed with a similar announcement last week. Administrators at other prominent women's colleges also are weighing changes.<br />
<br />
The discussions are, in part, an acknowledgment that thoughts on gender are evolving. Student activists have been steadily pushing for colleges to make changes, and some schools have altered applications to allow applicants to select "transgender" as a third option for gender or given them the option to discuss their gender identity in a short essay.<br />
<br />
"What it means to be a woman isn't static," says Mount Holyoke President Lynn Pasquerella, who announced the admissions policy change at the college's convocation ceremony. "Early feminists argued that reducing women to their biological functions was a foundation of women's oppression. We don't want to fall back on that."<br />
<br />
Other institutions, however, want to place limits on those students once they arrive on campus, including what sports they can play, which bathrooms they can use and where they can live.<br />
<br />
Simpson University, Spring Arbor University and George Fox University are among the Christian colleges that have recently sought and received a religious exemption from Title IX, the federal law banning gender-based discrimination in education.<br />
<br />
Pasquerella says her college's decision represents a counterpoint of sorts to those actions.<br />
<br />
"It's part of a national conversation," she said. "When you have Time magazine with (transgender actress) Laverne Cox on the cover and The New York Times running articles on transgender issues almost every week, it's part of mainstream discourse."<br />
<br />
But even within Mount Holyoke's extended community, the policy shifts have not been fully embraced. Some alumnae voiced their displeasure on the college's Facebook page following the announcement.<br />
<br />
"Mount Holyoke is a women's college, and it should admit women. Period. Full stop," wrote Pamela Adkins, a Tampa, Florida, resident who graduated from Mount Holyoke in 1979.<br />
<br />
In a follow up email, she said: "There are plenty of other places for people who are not women to go, and they should go there. Don't negate the reasons Mount Holyoke was founded and for what it has been known since 1837: providing a superlative college education — for women."<br />
<br />
Pasquerella acknowledged the detractors, but she said current students have been overwhelmingly supportive.<br />
<br />
Jennie Ochterski, a female senior and an organizer for Open Gates, a student group that had helped push for the admissions policy change, says she doesn't believe excluding trans women from admission fits with Mount Holyoke's mission.<br />
<br />
Marilyn Hammond, president of the Women's College Coalition, said she expects many of the 47 women's colleges in the U.S. and Canada will eventually develop formal admission policies on transgender students.<br />
<br />
She dismissed the notion that such policies dilute the mission of women's colleges, many of which were founded at a time when higher learning institutions were largely closed to women.<br />
<br />
"This is consistent with women's colleges' missions and historic willingness to address issues of diversity, inclusion and social justice," Hammond said.<br />
<br />
Transgender student activists are elated by the developments, which they say are long overdue. At the same time, they acknowledge there are bigger hurdles for their community overcome.<br />
<br />
"We must be wary of policies being thought of as actual change," says Eli Erlick, a transgender female at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who says she might have considered applying to a women's college had the admissions changes happened earlier. "No policy will change transphobic attitudes."<br />
<br />
Calliope Wong, a transgender female who garnered national headlines last year when she disclosed that Smith College had refused to review her application, says the debate over women's college admissions, if nothing else, can help highlight the myriad challenges transgender people face.<br />
<br />
"Hopefully this leads to changes in attitudes in general," said the University of Connecticut sophomore. "So that more people realize we do face employment discrimination and that we do have issues with legal representation and health care coverage."]]></description>
