			<b>So they aren't more dangerous to us than al Qaeda after all? Why would they have said that?</b><br />
<br />
by digby<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, wait a minute. &nbsp;The last I heard ISIS was so uniquely evil that they were even worse than al-Qaeda. In fact, they were so bad that al-Qaeda kicked them out of the gang because of their brutality.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/13/syria-obama-isis_n_5815388.html">So, what do we make of this?</a><br />
<blockquote>
While the Islamic State group is getting the most attention now, another band of extremists in Syria — a mix of hardened jihadis from Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and Europe — poses a more direct and imminent threat to the United States, working with Yemeni bomb-makers to target U.S. aviation, American officials say.<br />
<br />
At the center is a cell known as the Khorasan group, a cadre of veteran al-Qaida fighters from Afghanistan and Pakistan who traveled to Syria to link up with the al-Qaida affiliate there, the Nusra Front.<br />
<br />
But the Khorasan militants did not go to Syria principally to fight the government of President Bashar Assad, U.S. officials say. Instead, they were sent by al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to recruit Europeans and Americans whose passports allow them to board a U.S.-bound airliner with less scrutiny from security officials.<br />
<br />
In addition, according to classified U.S. intelligence assessments, the Khorasan militants have been working with bomb-makers from al-Qaida's Yemen affiliate to test new ways to slip explosives past airport security. The fear is that the Khorasan militants will provide these sophisticated explosives to their Western recruits who could sneak them onto U.S.-bound flights.<br />
<br />
The Obama administration has said that the Islamic State group, the target of more than 150 U.S. airstrikes in recent weeks, does not pose an imminent threat to the continental U.S. The Khorasan group, which has not been subject to American military action, is considered the more immediate threat.</blockquote>
<br />
So <i>al Qaeda</i> is actually the group that we must keep from killing us all in our beds, not ISIS?  Just like we've <i>been</i> keeping them from killing us in our beds for 13 years?<br />
<br />
Huh ...<br />
<br />
I'm being facetious and it's probably inappropriate. But <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/fyi-on-new-boogeyman.html">many of us have been pointing out for months</a> the reason Al Qaeda split with ISIS was because it was being <i>too brutal to fellow Muslims</i> when al Qaeda's mission was to take on the Great Satan --- just as it has been for a decade and a half. In other words, little had changed for Americans in the threat department. Al Qaeda still wants to kill us but we've been pretty successful at keeping them from doing that. For some reason we needed a new boogeyman. I wonder why?<br />
<br />
We've spent trillions on Homeland Security, outfitted every Barney Fife in the nation with robo-cop gear and allowed the government to spy on Americans at will. &nbsp;I don't know about you but I kind of expect that all of that should actually be worth something. If we're going to run around tearing our hair out every time somebody puts out a scary video maybe it's time to re-evaluate that strategy. <br />
<br />
This is not to say that there isn't a threat for the people in the Middle East and there is a legitimate argument to be made that it requires intervention from outside the region lest the whole place blows up even further. (I'm not sure we won't make things worse --- we usually do -- but I understand the arguments for it.) What is galling is the fact that they continue to treat us like children and tell us spooky bedtime stories so they can scare us into supporting their commercial/geopolitical goals. Maybe those goals are worth pursuing but we'll never know because we're chasing evil Ninjas who are allegedly coming over the border to unleash mushroom clouds on American cities. <br />
<br />
I'm serious.  This is what Fox News reporter Todd Starnes said on Hannity last night:<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
RT&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/toddstarnes">@toddstarnes</a> "what will O call it when there's a mushroom cloud over an American city because terrorists came over the border to attack"<br />
— Liberty Lives Here (@PJimmy18) <a href="https://twitter.com/PJimmy18/status/510620589028282369">September 13, 2014</a></blockquote>
<br />
And frankly, I'm almost as disgusted that the American people continue to be thrilled at the prospect of kicking ass over some trumped up threat --- and yes, I do believe that a whole lot of us are anxious to get back to the business of ass-kicking.  It's much more exciting than thinking about the wealthy elites stealing more and more of your meager earnings. But it's a dangerous and nasty way to entertain ourselves out of a nasty malaise. <br />
<br />
Al Qaeda has a strategy to create dramatic terrorist attacks on the West. &nbsp;We've known this for a long, long time. That has not changed. &nbsp;ISIS is a different problem. The fact that the war hawks pimped this line about ISIS being worse than Al Qaeda should make everyone skeptical of what they are hearing about this whole thing --- and skeptical of the motivations behind it. &nbsp;How many times do we have to be lied to?<br />

As so many Villagers love to do, Chuck Todd&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hughhewitt.com/chuck-todd-romney-3-0/">appeared with right winger Hugh Hewitt</a> the other day. They chit-chatted about this and that, but I thought this conclusion was particularly fascinating</div>
<br />
<blockquote>
HH: &nbsp;... I want to ask you the Politico question. In today’s Politico, Robert C. O’Brien and I write an article called Romney 3.0, Third Time’s A Charm. What do you think? Is it possible he’s going to get in?&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote>
CT: I think he only gets in if he’s drafted. I feel like that that’s the hint he’s been saying, and I’ve talked to some folks who know him very well. He is not going to go through a grueling primary campaign. He is not going to sit here and defend his conservative credentials again, go through schlepping around, allowing all these guys to take pot shots on him. I think he is open to this if it’s a draft movement, and if it’s sort of like everybody else doesn’t fit.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Now here’s why I think Mitt Romney, it’s funny you bring this up, because I think the reason why Romney 3.0 has gotten traction is less about Romney, and more about the current issues of the day. I think the Republican 2016 field as we thought we knew it, think Scott Walker, think Chris Christie, think Marco Rubio, think Bobby Jindal, you know, throw those names in. I think if you have issues like national security front and center, that’s an incredibly shrinking, I feel like all of those guys are suddenly shrinking in stature. None of them, if the chief criticism of Barack Obama by a lot of people is you know what, he just wasn’t experienced enough, he just didn’t have a grasp of everything you needed to know to be able to be commander-in-chief, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>
HH: Yeah.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote>
CT: That’s among, particularly among the conservative criticisms. Well then, how does Scott Walker fit into that? How does Chris Christie? How does Bobby Jindal? How does Marco Rubio? You know, they don’t, and so suddenly, Mitt Romney, while not having a lot of experience on foreign policy, certainly running for president and certainly now he can go back and say hey, I made these points against the President, and I look a little more prescient today than maybe some people thought three years ago.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote>
So I think that’s why he seems to look larger right now in stature because of the issues of the day that are front and center, and if you look at the rest of this Republican field. They don’t seem as if they have the resume to reassure hawks in the party.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote>
HH: Prescient as always. Chuck Todd, we’ll be watching Sunday for Jim Baker. Thanks for joining us.</blockquote>
Todd's absolutely correct. All of these ex-Governors with no foreign policy experience don't look all that exciting when the focus is on foreign policy. That's why Mitt Romney, the ex-Governor with no foreign policy experience, is such an intriguing prospect. He's run for president twice and lost which is almost the same thing as being Commander in Chief. &nbsp;Plus he can say I told you so, which is always a reassuring appeal.<br />
<br />
Really, is there any other choice?<br />
<br />
Prescient as always.<br />

<br />
There are only so many dead painters these rich people can employ at a time so <a href="http://www.pressprogress.ca/en/post/important-new-study-says-economy-sucks-because-people-are-paid-peanuts">this</a> seems like common sense to me, but waddo I know?<br />
<blockquote>
That's the big take-away from a new report prepared for G20 labour and employment ministers by three global economic organizations: the United Nations' International Labour Organization, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the World Bank.<br />
<br />
"Extensive evidence shows that high levels of income inequality tend to reinforce themselves," says the report. And this has a negative impact on "long-term growth protential."<br />
<br />
The report zeros in on "stagnating wage income" and a "deterioration in job quality" across advanced G20 economies, pointing to a "long-term decline" in the share of wealth in the pockets of workers:<br />

			<p><b>Are we holding the leash or wearing the collar?</b></p><p>
by Tom Sullivan</p><p>

Naomi Klein <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/13/greenwashing-sticky-business-naomi-klein">contemplates</a> the struggle between climate change and the globalization juggernaut. It is a struggle she once left to environmentalists. But having struggled with infertility and having covered the Gulf oil spill, her perspective changed. "It's not that I got in touch with my inner Earth Mother," Klein writes, "it's that I started to notice that if the Earth is indeed our mother, then she is a mother facing a great many fertility challenges of her own."</p><p>

That climate change is linked to our lifestyle and our economy – and our attempts to deal with planetary warming without changing either – is the crux of Klein's long piece in the Guardian:</p>
<blockquote>"What is wrong with us? I think the answer is far more simple than many have led us to believe: we have not done the things needed to cut emissions because those things fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism, the reigning ideology for the entire period we have struggled to find a way out of this crisis. We are stuck, because the actions that would give us the best chance of averting catastrophe – and benefit the vast majority – are threatening to an elite minority with a stranglehold over our economy, political process and media."</blockquote>Read: Billionaires with good intentions, flashy pronouncements, and market-driven solutions have failed to curb emissions. Much of the piece focuses on Richard Branson's failed, but much ballyhooed efforts to apply a the same business savvy that made him rich to save the planet.</p><p>

<blockquote>The idea that only capitalism can save the world from a crisis it created is no longer an abstract theory; it's a hypothesis that has been tested in the real world. We can now take a hard look at the results: at the green products shunted to the back of the supermarket shelves at the first signs of recession; at the venture capitalists who were meant to bankroll a parade of innovation but have come up far short; at the fraud-infested, boom-and-bust carbon market that has failed to cut emissions. And, most of all, at the billionaires who were going to invent a new form of enlightened capitalism but decided, on second thoughts, that the old one was just too profitable to surrender.</blockquote>

Post-Reagan, deregulated capitalism has long looked like something out of <a href="http://scrutinyhooligans.us/2010/09/05/shortage-of-work-day/">Mary Shelley or science-fiction films</a>, a creature we created, but no longer control. Billionaires and their acolytes see only its benefits, but as Jeff Goldblum's Dr. Ian Malcolm says in <i>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</i>, "<a href="http://www.hark.com/clips/vxsnntctsg-how-it-starts">Oh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running, and then screaming.</a>" Where once We the People held capitalism's leash, now we wear the collar.</p><p> 

Whether it's turning your child's education from a shared public cost into a corporate profit center; or turning the principle of one-man, one-vote into one-dollar, one-vote; or carbon tax credits and accounting tricks for addressing rising sea levels; questioning the universal application of a business approach to any human need or problem prompts the challenge, "Do you have something against making a profit?" A more subtle form of red-baiting, this ploy is supposed to be a conversation stopper. Yes? You're a commie. Game over.</p><p>  

Maybe it's time our billionaire problem-solvers got over themselves.</p> <br>

He wasn't the only one using the bodies of the dead to get what he wanted. The desire for vengeance was stoked and consciously used by the Bush/Cheney White House to get us into Iraq. But the sale of war in Iraq needed more than raw emotion from 2001, it needed mind-changing visuals, serious authority figures, big money support and clever catch phrases. Remember:<br />

<br />
<br />
They won't be able to do it again, right? We are smarter now. Many of us even spotted it all at the time. But it didn't stop the war train. How do we use our knowledge this time?<br />
<br />
Can they use our emotion like last time? After 13 years the confusion, sadness, anger and desire to act has diminished. &nbsp;And now we have been&nbsp;lied to. And bilked. And emotionally manipulated by professionals.<br />
<br />
If someone wants to evoke that 9/12 feeling again they need a fresh jolt to the system. Like beheadings.<br />
<br />
Following 9/12/2001 the rage and anger was scaled up to include entire regions. The right wing wanted an entire religious faith to be punished. Any suggestion of trying to understand who did it and why it happened was mocked. Anything less than "glass parking lots" was "letting the terrorists win."<br />
<br />
But in 2014 you can start asking questions. Might there be another way to deal with this current atrocity? Can there be a direct police-type action for the crime?<br />
<br />
We've learned from the 2003 run up to the Iraq War. Yes, a lot of us knew what was up at the time, but our protests were ignored. What will we do differently this time? New chants? Or can we use the tools and leverage we have now we didn't have before?<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Fall War Launch Needs New Words, Images, People and Emotion</b><br />
<br />
We know how they sold the Iraq War to us. Spot the tricks this time! Look for:<br />
<br />
<b>Words.</b> Notice the words and phrases being used this time. "<b>Boots on the ground.</b>" It's all about protecting our people. Drones aren't "boots in the air" so they are fine. This shift in focus from people to machines&nbsp;<b>should </b>lead us to<b> look at the cost,</b> but will it?<br />
<br />
Keep an eye on&nbsp;the word&nbsp;<b>degrade</b>, that's an emotional word pawned off as a military and physical action. Degrade has that, "It happens over a long period of time" feeling to it. That's intentional.<br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>Images.</b>&nbsp;The beheading videos are powerful, but they won't be showing them over and over. That means the military will offer up successful bombing videos--from a distance. Look for what they don't want us to see.<br />
Closer in photos of the innocent dead.<br />
<br />
Of course if these photos slip out they will be condemned as inciting violence toward us. The people who provide them (or retweet and publish them) will be labeled traitors for &nbsp;helping the terrorists. Fox News will remind people of all the bad people we killed without loss of US lives. They will probably do a fair and balanced chart of it.<br />
<br />
<b>People.</b>&nbsp;Keep an eye out for the retired Generals. Who pays them? Do they work for people selling drones? &nbsp;<b>Could someone please check them now?</b> Call the TV producers and demand they mention their affiliations. Also, who is paying the think tank people? Foreign governments? Defense contractors?<br />
<br />
The media already has brought on tired old "experts" to make the case for war, but <b>who is new in the media opposing war?</b>&nbsp;If our "boots on the ground" aren't in danger, can we get some accountants on to talk about the cost of these drone strikes? &nbsp;How about representatives of the innocent dead? Someone from a Big 8 Peace firm? &nbsp;Who do you suggest?<br />
<br />
<b>Emotion</b>. If they can't get anger, they will go for fear. Any attack in the US or on US interests will be linked to ISIL faster than you can say, Al Qaeda in Iraq.<br />
<br />
I've heard three experts say it would be very hard for ISIL to attack the US. They will find someone who says they can. He will be in heavy rotation on Fox.<br />
<br />
How do you stop them from using emotion? You can't, but you can offer other emotions. Like courage.<br />
<br />
<b>Denying Them Their War Propoganda</b><br />
<br />
David Swanson wrote an interesting piece, &nbsp;<a href="http://my.firedoglake.com/davidswanson/2014/09/12/james-foley-is-not-a-war-ad/">James Foley Is Not a War Ad</a><br />
<br />
He makes the point, with video to back it up, that Foley would not have wanted the video of his death to be used this way.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
What if people in the United States were to watch the video of Foley when he was alive and speaking and laughing, not the one when he was a prop in a piece of propaganda almost certainly aimed at provoking the violence that Obama has just obligingly announced?</blockquote>
I can't speak for the dead, Foley was human and I understand the reaction of most, "Let's get the bastards who did this." &nbsp;But who he was leads me to believe he wouldn't want his death to be scaled up to a war.<br />
<br />
We can't control the actions of the group called ISIL, but we can control our response to them. Let's not let the bastards who lied and manipulated us into the last war get away with it again.<br />

A nice reminder that this person might have been involved in making policy:<br />
<blockquote>"They are so full of deception that America should be concerned with the policies that are going on. And, as I watched the speech last night, Sean, the thought going through my mind is ‘I owe America a global apology. Because John McCain, through all of this, John McCain should be our president.’ He had the advice, today, still giving it to Barack Obama, and he will not listen to it, about the residual forces that must be left behind in order to secure the peace in Iraq that we had fought so hard for.”<br />
<br />
“That triangle, of course, the foundation in the region of their power, for it to be taken over by the bad guys, that could have been avoided had Barack Obama listened to the best military advice, and that was ‘Barack, you have to leave that residual force in order to continue what it is we are doing.’ We don’t have to have combat troops over there at that time, but that residual force in order to secure….but, no, and now here we are saying, uh, well, it’s going to take boots on the ground to win this thing, and yet, we’re not going to send boots on the ground? We’re going to contract this thing out when there is no mightier power than the red, white, and blue?”<br />

<a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/12/rush_limbaugh_on_this_domestic_violence_stuff_and_the_nfl_%E2%80%9Cif_we_keep_feminizing_this_game_we%E2%80%99re_going_to_ruin_it%E2%80%9D/">According to Rush</a> everyone's ruining the game of football by denouncing domestic violence:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
“Folks, … this is crazy,” Rush Limbaugh said on the Friday edition of his successful radio talk show. “We’re feminizing this game, and it’s a man’s game, and if we keep feminizing this game, we’re going to ruin it; if we keep ‘chickifying’ this game, we’re going to ruin it. It’s going to become something that it was never intended to be.”<br />
<br />
Limbaugh’s worry came in response to the growing demands for introspection being directed toward the NFL in the wake of the public release of video showing Ray Rice assaulting his partner. “So many men — executive in the league, and sports [media] — are in a race to see who can be the most politically correct, feminized guy,” Limbaugh said. “It’s comical.”</blockquote>
Seriously, what kind of a real man doesn't knock out his girlfriend in an elevator once in a while, amirite? And the fact that he didn't even seem to be slightly concerned about the fact that she was <i>unconscious</i> just further proves his manliness. He dragged her out of the elevator didn't he? What more do these feminazis want? <br />
<br />
I honestly don't know what it will take for decent people to reject Rush LImbaugh, but you would think that any decent person would find these comments beyond the pale.  It's fair to assume that anyone who doesn't isn't a decent person.<br />

I'm getting some blowback for suggesting that this argument about congressional authorization is a dodge, but I honestly believe that &nbsp;it's inevitable that the congress will approve it if they decide to take it up. &nbsp;Therefore, it doesn't matter if they take it up.<br />
<br />
This is happening. It has been happening with regularity since 1991 under presidents of both parties regardless of congressional approval.<br />

			<b>Is it time to revisit our prohibition on paying ransom?</b><br />

<br />
Uhm, if true, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/government-threatened-foley-family-ransom-payments-mother-slain/story?id=25453963">this is just horrible:</a><br />
<br />
<blockquote>
Obama administration officials repeatedly threatened the family of murdered journalist James Foley that they might face criminal charges for supporting terrorism if they paid ransom to the ISIS killers who ultimately beheaded their son, his mother and brother said this week.<br />
<br />
"We were told that several times and we took it as a threat and it was appalling," Foley's mother Diane told ABC News in an interview.<br />
<br />
She said the warnings over the summer came primarily from a highly decorated military officer serving on the White House's National Security Council staff, which five outraged current and former officials with direct knowledge of the Foley case also recounted to ABC News in recent weeks.<br />
<br />
"Three times he intimidated us with that message. We were horrified he would say that. He just told us we would be prosecuted. We knew we had to save our son, we had to try," Diane Foley said.</blockquote>
<br />
Nice, really nice ...<br />
<br />
<a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/americans-dont-seem-to-be-as-eager-for.html">As I've written before</a>, this issue of ransom is one that has to be discussed more fully especially not that warhawks <i>and</i> terrorists are using the recorded execution of hostages for propaganda and recruitment purposes. I don't think our adamant refusal to ever "negotiate with terrorists" is getting the results we want. Not claiming to have the answer here, but something's gone wrong. <br />
<br />
And threatening the family of someone who ended up being publicly beheaded with criminal charges of aiding terrorism is just disgusting. And I don't know that this is even official US policy. According to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/21/the-logic-of-not-paying-ransoms/">this article </a>it isn't:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
The U.S. government certainly tried to save James Foley before he was executed by Islamic State extremists. Sources have told The Washington Post that a secret raid was conducted in a bid to save the American journalist and others. It failed because the hostages were not at that location at that moment.<br />
<br />
However, there may have been one big tactic they didn't try: paying a ransom. David Rohde, a well-respected journalist who works at the Atlantic and the Reuters news agency, touched upon this Wednesday, when he wondered whether U.S. foreign policy had failed Foley with its refusal to negotiate with his captors. Rohde points out that journalists of other nationalities were apparently released after their governments paid large sums to the Islamic State, something the U.S. government refuses to do (though private individuals and entities may).</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/20/rohde-foley-idUSL2N0QQ23920140820">Rohde has spoken out about this before</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the days and weeks ahead, the Foley family will speak for themselves about their ordeal. But the payment of ransoms and abduction of foreigners must emerge from the shadows. It must be publicly debated. American and European policymakers should be forced to answer for their actions.<br />
<br />
Foley believed that his government would help him, according to his family. In a message that was not made public, Foley said that he believed so strongly that Washington would help that he refused to allow his fellow American captives to not believe in their government.<br />
<br />
A consistent response to kidnapping by the U.S. and Europe is desperately needed. The current haphazard approach is failing.</blockquote>
If what the Foley family is saying is true, we have a major problem on our hands. Threatening the family of an abducted journalist with criminal charges for terrorism is indeed appalling. But the fact that everyone, including the president, is using the execution of these prisoners as a rationale for military action &nbsp;means that this policy has major ramifications we have not fully examined.<br />

			<b>Are Americans just frustrated?</b><br />
<br />
by digby<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-remarks-on-strategy-to-confront-isis">QOTD: Senator Chris Murphy</a><br />
<blockquote>
Americans today, more than ever, feel like they have lost control of their lives, of their ability to feel financially, economically, and even physically secure. These videos, and reports of ISIS’s unconscionable brutality, add to this feeling of insecurity. And they invoke rage –justifiable, appropriate rage – about those who would carry out such acts.<br />
<br />
In this case, the fear and the anger that we feel about ISIS’s actions is complemented by a legitimate threat that this group poses. So we shouldn’t hesitate to act, simply because our desire to do so is fueled by the intense emotion that this enemy engenders in us. But our response – the details of our strategy – cannot be dictated by these impulses. Our plan of attack against ISIS needs to be well thought-out, nuanced, not rushed into because we feel an emotional compulsion to do something – anything – right now.<br />
<br />
We’ve made that mistake in the past as a nation, and we shouldn’t misstep again. And we certainly shouldn’t allow election year politics to play into our calculations. This is a debate about ISIS, but it’s also a debate about how we’re going to meet a potential plethora of anti-Western extremist groups that are, and will, organize against us throughout the world. We’re creating a precedent for action, and we shouldn’t rush into action simply because we feel pressure to get something done before an election. As the President noted last night, and it’s important to repeat, ISIS today does not have imminent plans to attack the United States. That doesn’t diminish the necessity of taking them on, it simply means that we don’t need to engage in a panicked response.</blockquote>
I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who recognizes that Americans are frustrated by the chaotic nature of the world today and their own feelings of powerlessness and so are ready to engage in some "action" --- any action &nbsp;--- to assert control. And it's good that someone is recognizing how the financial and economic insecurities of our time might lead us into making some major errors in judgment. Since we are a military empire, those errors in judgment about what action to take are unfortunately likely to fall into that category.<br />
<br />
If you read the rest of his comments you'll see that the ship has sailed, however.  He's backing the president's strategy for the most part while cautioning him about mission creep and demanding a debate in congress, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/11/rachel_maddow_rand_paul_mitch_mcconnell_agree_but_the_isis_debate_they_want_simply_wont_matter/">which I argue here in Salon</a>, is one of those procedural dodges in any case.  Yes, the congress should debate. But let's not bullshit ourselves into believing it will make some sort of difference.  It never has before. If the congress votes, whether for explicit authorization or simply for the funding, they will find a majority to support. Murphy says the president will get his authorization if he wants it. &nbsp;Everyone says he'll get his authorization. Every member of congress is deciding right now whether it's best to be on record supporting or opposing, calculating the odds down the road. Maybe they'll let the president take all the risk and the potential glory. &nbsp;If I had to bet, I'd say they'll vote.  And if they vote, they will vote yes. And if they don't vote, it's happening anyway. &nbsp;So why are we obsessing about this?<br />
<br />
This whole argument reminds me of the one before the Iraq war in which all of us liberals --- myself included --- argued vociferously for UN authorization as if that was the be-all and end all of the issue at hand. &nbsp;But the real issue was the decision to invade Iraq and it would have been wrong whether we did it under the auspices of the UN or not. &nbsp;UN approval wouldn't have changed it and arguing as if that was what really mattered made it seem as though the process was more important than the result. &nbsp;And when it comes to war, I don't think that's true at all, particularly since once you've reached the stage of asking for permission the default is almost always to defer to war anyway.<br />
<br />
Certainly the congress in the US is most likely to rubber stamp whatever the president wants to do in these matters. There is very little precedent for anything else and if you look at the political make-up of both houses you are not going to see an anti-war majority in either one. &nbsp;So all of our braying about congressional authorization has no potential to change the decision to escalate in Iraq and Syria. (Now, down the road, if it all goes wrong, they can try to use the power of the purse to pull the president back, but for right now, the di is cast. ) We're going, and the only question is whether congress wants to be part of the show. They will not stop it at this point.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Murphy is right that this should not be done out of a sense of frustration that the world is chaotic place and Americans can't seem to get a grip. But that's part of what's motivating this willingness to be baited into action by these dramatic videos.  I've always been skeptical of the "no-drama Obama" business but I've been glad he seemed to be taking a deliberate approach and not stoking this sense of alarm in this situation.  His speech, unfortunately, broke with that and he sounded a lot more like George W. Bush than I've ever heard him sound before. That's too bad. I get it. He was baited too, and not just by ISIS but by American warmongers. Still, I had hoped for less flag-waving and more "keep calm and carry on." <br />

			<p><b>An economic cult</b></p><p>

by Tom Sullivan</p><p>

Paul Krugman this morning <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/opinion/paul-krugman-the-inflation-cult.html?_r=0">writes</a> about "the inflation cult," doomsaying pundits and supposed economic experts who, economic rain or shine, predict that a steep rise in inflation is coming anytime now and, quite reliably, get it wrong time after time.</p>
<blockquote>Part of that appeal is clearly political; there’s a reason why Mr. Santelli yells about both inflation and how President Obama <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2009/02/cnbcs-santelli/">is giving money away to “losers,”</a> why Mr. Ryan warns about both a debased currency and a government that <a href="http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/13/paul-ryan/has-ryan-remained-consistent-talking-about-what-h-/">redistributes from “makers” to “takers.”</a> Inflation cultists almost always link the Fed’s policies to complaints about government spending. They’re completely wrong about the details — no, the Fed isn’t printing money to cover the budget deficit — but it’s true that governments whose debt is denominated in a currency they can issue have more fiscal flexibility, and hence more ability to maintain aid to those in need, than governments that don’t.</p><p>

And anger against “takers” — anger that is very much tied up with ethnic and cultural divisions — runs deep. Many people, therefore, feel an affinity with those who rant about looming inflation; Mr. Santelli is their kind of guy. In an important sense, I’d argue, the persistence of the inflation cult is an example of the “affinity fraud” crucial to many swindles, in which investors trust a con man because he seems to be part of their tribe. In this case, the con men may be conning themselves as well as their followers, but that hardly matters.</p><p>

This tribal interpretation of the inflation cult helps explain the sheer rage you encounter when pointing out that the promised hyperinflation is nowhere to be seen. It’s comparable to the reaction you get when pointing out that Obamacare seems to be working, and probably has the same roots.</p>
</blockquote>Not just economists, but the country (and perhaps the entire Republican Party) seems to be in the grip of an economic cult concerned with much more than inflation -- that's just a symptom. As Krugman suggests, ethnic and cultural (and class) divisions factor into it. Digby has written repeatedly (and just yesterday) that many of the same people "<a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-gates-of-hell-brought-to-you-by.html">have always been wrong about everything</a>." And yet, their followers keep listening. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rick-perlstein/i-didnt-like-nixon-_b_11735.html">Conservatism never fails</a>. It is <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pseudoscience#Ideas_are_unfalsifiable">unfalsifiable</a>. I wrote <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/like-beer-youll-love-koch-by-bloggersrus.html">last week</a> that the Koch brothers' evangelism for the their libertarian Kochification Church resembles recruiting techniques used by cults.</p><p>

Matt Yglesias delivers <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/11/6135197/obamas-risky-isis-rhetoric">an interesting critique </a>of President Obama's strategy and rhetoric. &nbsp;I tend to agree that the regional coalition is a no-brainer and that the bombing campaign in Iraq was just inevitable.  (It's been our catch-all strategy for decades now ...) The long term prospects for "eradicating" ISIS through such a strategy are not good, but they could be slowed at least in some respects. The potential of unintended consequences is growing by the minute.<br />
<br />
However, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/11/6135197/obamas-risky-isis-rhetoric">Yglesias points out</a> that the real danger here is exacerbating the threat with all this sabre rattling. (Apparently, everything at Vox has to be in list form ...?)<br />
<blockquote>7) The biggest problem with Obama's current approach isn't what he's promising to do, but what he's promising to accomplish. Over the course of 2014, Obama's anti-ISIS statements have become increasingly dire and alarmist.<br />
<br />
8) The shift in tone appears to have two causes. One is backlash to his ill-advised quip about ISIS being global jihad's JV team. The other is polling indicating that the American public was profoundly affected by the execution videos, which were the single most widely-noted news event since 2009.<br />
<br />
9) Public opinion always matters in politics and therefore in policymaking, but the fact of the matter is that the American people have this a bit mixed up. The beheadings are not the most alarming thing ISIS did this summer (try taking Mosul or genocidal violence against religious minority groups) and the rise of ISIS isn't even the summer's most alarming foreign policy crisis (try Russia's invasion of Ukraine and apparent probing of Estonian and Finnish borders). There is no good reason for the United States to take maximal action against ISIS, not least because none of our potential partners in the region are going to.<br />
<br />
10) Alarmist rhetoric and a policy of wise restraint make odd bedfellows. If the US catches some lucky breaks (or ISIS some bad ones) it may all work out for the best. But Obama's speeches are writing checks his policy can't necessarily cash. And eliminating ISIS' ability to occasional kidnap westerners who travel into the conflict zone is much more difficult than eliminating its ability to capture new Iraqi cities or threaten major oil fields. If another shoe drops in a bad way, there is enormous risk that the president has set the country up for a cycle of unwise escalation.<br />
<br />
11) "We will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq," Obama promised last night. Certainly we shouldn't. But in the context of the administration's stated aspirations, this is more of a vague hope than anything else. If Obama really wants to stick to the policy he's outlined, he needs to find a more measured way to describe what he's promising it will achieve.</blockquote>It seems to me that he's overreacting to criticism and that's a bad thing in these situations. People will calm down about the beheading videos if our leadership stays calm and reassuring. The only reason not to is to gin up support for war --- and if Obama has finally come around to that way of thinking it's very disappointing. He doesn't need the nation to be hysterical over this simply because Huckleberry Graham is waving his hands and calling for the fainting couch.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/09/obama-iraq-isis-speech">David Corn asked the right question</a> about all this (and not just the rhetoric, but the strategy itself) in this piece:<br />
<blockquote>After depicting ISIS as a peril warranting a US military response—and with much of the American public convinced of that—can he then shrug his shoulders and say never mind? Will he provide the hawks an opening for political attacks and demands for greater military intervention? In his speech, the man who ran for president with the pledge to end the Iraq war declared, “we will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq.” But what if all else fails? He vowed to eradicate the ISIS “cancer,” noting it will take time to do so. Can he stop if his non-war counter-terrorism campaign does not defeat the disease? It is hard to put the case for war back in the box.</blockquote>He's right.  Once you start with the chest beating about a mortal enemy such as the world has rarely known, you trap yourself into acting, something the president had thus far adroitly avoided. As Ed Kilgore <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2014_09/it_is_hard_to_put_the_case_for052050.php">wisely pointed out</a>:<br />
<blockquote>It doesn’t help that Obama closed his speech, as I noted last night, with an appeal to American Exceptionalism: if we don’t “destroy” IS, we’re not simply exposing U.S. interests to danger, but skewing the moral compass of the whole world. That distorted self-image of the United States as the first, last and only resort for the vindication of wrongs is also difficult to “put back in the box” after it’s projected so often, even as a rhetorical afterthought. </blockquote><br />
I think this is about America itself feeling a lack of control over all these recent chaotic events, including the collapse of the economy, and demanding that the government take some sort of action. Which is ironic since the cognoscenti are determined to portray the country as a bunch of isolationist, small government libertarian/conservatives who just want to be left alone to pray. In reality, everyone knows we're a big, rich, badass military empire and a majority of Americans don't like the fact that other people in the world think they have some agency to act while we sit around watching our standard of living go down and our future prospects dim. &nbsp;(The fact that much of our problem stems from our being a big-badass military empire hasn't really penetrated.) So the president has simply come around to giving them what they want.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Update:<b></b></b> Yeah, baby.  <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/house-republicans-torn-on-obama-syria-request-20140911">Now we're talking:</a><br />
<br />
<blockquote>Rep. John Fleming said many see the president's strategy as not nearly enough.<br />
<br />
"This is a stalemate strategy," he said. "I think that we would want to see an all-out war, shock and awe. We put troops on the ground, we put all of our assets there after properly prepping the battlefield, and in a matter of a few weeks we take these guys out … and we leave a stay-behind force to keep our friends up and going, and also maybe a no-fly zone in Syria over the area Assad controls."<br />
<br />
Others are worried that the situation will escalate and noted their constituents are, too. Rep. John Carter, whose Texas district includes Fort Hood and who chairs the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, said he told members in the meeting that if Congress is going to commit to this strategy, it must fund the military at a higher level.<br />
<br />
"If we're going to do this, nobody's that got any sense can think any way other than we will eventually have boots on the ground. We already have 1,500. Those people are not wearing ballet slippers over there," said Carter. "And so the reality is, if we're asking these tired, overcommitted quite patriotic families to do this some more, we've got to start reinforcing them. We've got to start building our military back, not cutting it."</blockquote><br />

<br />

<br />
<blockquote>
War is hell. So go big or go home, Mr. President. Big means bold, confident, wise assurance from a trustworthy Commander-in-Chief that it shall all be worth it. Charge in, strike hard, get out. Win.<br />
<br />
Obama famously claims to despise the “theater” and “optics” of the presidency. In tonight's speech he illustrated the “optics” of toughness. He tried to show a war-weary America that he’s tough in his speech concerning the threat of ISIS/ISIL. “The One” who believes in leading from behind can’t have it both ways. He sure wasn’t concerned about “optics” when he let the crisis starring this Islamic death cult reach this point as he dithered and danced and golfed the time away while the Middle East exploded into chaos.<br />
<br />
Tonight he announced he’s flipped and will finally militarily engage inside Syria – the red line he’d set and then forgotten about surfaced again. This, after three and a half years of civil war, 200,000 people killed, and millions displaced amid horrifying humanitarian conditions. Last month, he authorized U.S. military action to stall ISIS’ momentum as it’s taken nearly complete control of Iraq. Tonight, President Obama pledged to fight Islamic militants “wherever they exist” with a very small coalition of the willing. (Can you blame foreign nations for not trusting the resolve of this president enough to join us? Right now he has a coalition of nine; President Bush had over 40 allied countries that could trust America’s leadership.)<br />
<br />
Remember the inexperienced presidential candidate speaking from Germany at the Brandenburg Gate (2008)? Or the know-it-all state senator (2002), known for merely voting “present” on the big things, yet lecturing about this “dumb war” he claimed was a distraction from his desire to force income redistribution to create security. Remember him? Today, he seems more worried about contradicting his campaign promises (2002-2008) and typical political poll angst than leading as president (2009-present). These are the “optics” he's worried about.<br />
<br />
The rise of the animalistic terror group, ISIS, is the result of Obama’s lead-from-behind foreign policy. He had broadcast his war strategy for all the enemy to see in Iraq, so the enemy could wait us out and strike as soon as America turned tail and turned away from all we’d sacrificed there. Terrorists who we had under control got to regroup and grow after Obama’s premature pull out. Those are the facts, and some tough talking speech is still just talk. Ronald Reagan was described by the Soviets as a politician for whom “words and deeds are one and the same.” When Reagan said his vision of the Cold War was “we win, they lose,” he meant it, and his policies won the Cold War. The real question Americans and our allies must ask is whether Obama-the-lecturer's words will translate into deeds.<br />
<br />
Go big and be real, Mr. President, if you've really changed your mind again and now wish to engage. You must acknowledge reality: the organization calling itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is, in fact, “Islamic.” Not many of us pretend to be experts on the Muslim religion, but these terrorists obviously consider themselves Muslim and they believe what they’re horrifically doing to innocents is part of their “religion of peace.” So, you can use your soapbox to fiercely encourage the sane, civilized Muslims of the world to tell ISIS and all these sickening terrorists that they’re wrong. In the meantime, we must identify and understand the enemy by at least acknowledging their ideological motivation and identity. Our president is naive to ignore this.<br />
<br />
ISIS must be stopped in Iraq and Syria before we need to stop them anywhere else. As they dominate the region they head for us; we're next on the hit list. For the sake of peace-loving people in America and throughout the world, let’s hope Barack Obama means what he says when he uses terms like “defeating ISIS.” He is so inconsistent in leading a failed agenda that it’s virtually impossible to put any hope in his new promises, because either his past statements shrugging off ISIS as just a “JV squad” was all talk or tonight’s new terminology is just all talk.<br />
<br />
We should honor and understand our brave men and women of the U.S. armed forces today more than ever. Please do not support politicians who join Obama in diminishing our military. Our finest, trained to fight for what is right and determined to win, deserve our support. Thank you, military, may you be heard when you pray America’s leadership understands that if we’re in it, then we're in it to win it; no half measures. Troops, we are always with you.<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh, were you under the impression that the right wing wasn't pro-war anymore?  That they had turned into some amalgam of John Galt and Robert Taft? <br />
<br />
No, they're the same old bloodthirsty warmongers they always were. Counting on anyone besides Justin Amash and maybe a handful of wingnuts who just want to stick it to Obama to oppose any escalation in killing is a fools errand. This is what it's all about for them. <br />
<br />
And, by the way, from what I'm seeing there are more than a few liberals who might disagree with her criticism of Obama but wouldn't really argue too much with her exhortation to "Win" whatever the hell that means.  Evidently, they too are concerned that ISIS is coming to kill them any day now. <br />

Why is it that prosecutors are so loathe to admit that they might have made a mistake? &nbsp;Apparently, it's a psychological tick that we all have. But it seems to me that prosecutors have a particular responsibility to be open to error --- and if they aren't we should have better mechanisms for ensuring that they are. The legal system doesn't seem to be very good at it.<br />
<br />
But then, this is a wider political and sociological problem as well, isn't it? &nbsp;Just look at how our political system protects the likes of Dick Cheney and other torture advocates? They aren't even shunned &nbsp;--- they're welcomed back into respectable company as if it never happened.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there's a problem, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/10/%E2%80%9Cthey_refuse_to_admit_they_were_wrong%E2%80%9D_how_nightmare_prosecutors_pervert_american_justice/">which I discussed in more detail in this piece for Salon</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
Yesterday, historian Rick Perlstein wrote <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/08/watergates_most_lasting_sin_gerald_ford_richard_nixon_and_the_pardon_that_made_us_all_cynics/">an important piece about the Nixon pardon</a>, which he shows was the true beginning of the political culture that holds that business elites and government actors cannot be held accountable for corruption and malfeasance because it will “destabilize” the system. From pardons of presidents to too-big-to-fail banks to torturers getting the benefit of “not looking in the rearview mirror,” it’s hard to come up with an example of elite, institutional players having to face the music.<br />
<br />
But one of the more confounding aspects of this unaccountable culture of ours is the one that says the legal system has no responsibility to right its own wrongs or even admit to a lack of perfection even when it’s obvious they have made a grievous error (or broke the law). Yesterday I wrote about Justice <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/08/scalias_utter_moral_failure_how_he_destroys_any_claim_to_a_superior_system_of_justice/">Antonin Scalia’s rather shocking opinion</a> that the Constitution provides no avenue for an innocent person wrongfully condemned to be released if all the proper i’s were dotted and the t’s crossed.  That strikes me as a perverted definition of justice. But it goes even deeper than that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
This is the central irony of Obama’s speech—and, it must be said, of his approach. The caution that he has shown, the time that he has taken to reach a decision, are admirable and wise; the course of action that he has set out is, despite its increasing scope, narrowly targeted. (This is no war on terror or on radical Islam.) Even so, as he acknowledged last night, “we cannot do for Iraqis what they must do for themselves.” And there is, at this point, little to suggest that Iraqis can do much of anything for themselves but continue their slide into mutual mistrust and retributive violence. The security forces that Obama has now pledged to train, equip, and advise are seen, by many Sunnis, as a force of subjugation; Shiite militias, empowered by the previous Iraqi government and backed by Iran, have terrorized the population we intend to protect. The situation in Syria is less promising still. The anti-Assad rebels there have been unable to keep their weapons out of the hands of ISIS, which does raise the question: which side will we be arming?<br />
<br />
In this sense, last night’s peroration—with its ode to American exceptionalism—was beside the point. Not because America isn’t terrific, which it is, or because our “technology companies and universities” aren’t “unmatched,” which they are, but because America’s success in this new and important mission will not depend, in the last analysis, on our values, our strength, or our can-do spirit. It will depend on partners who are at best unreliable and possibly incapable. If they falter, what becomes of the U.S. effort? That question was neither asked nor answered in the President’s speech, but there is always next year.</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3249.htm">It's time for a little reminder of how we got here:</a><br />
<blockquote>
The neoconservative Project for a New American Century laid much of the groundwork for the foreign policy of the Bush administration. Its members received important postings in the White House, Department of Defense and other institutions. But what is seldom mentioned is that PNAC achieved its first great political victory during the Clinton administration when PNAC pushed Clinton to sign the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. <br />
<br />
In January 1998, the group wrote to Clinton: “[Y]ou have an opportunity to chart a clear and determined course for meeting this threat. We urge you to seize that opportunity, and to enunciate a new strategy that would secure the interests of the U.S. and our friends and allies around the world. That strategy should aim, above all, at the removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime from power.” <br />
<br />
The Iraq Liberation Act, backed overwhelmingly by Democrats and Republicans and signed by Clinton, made regime change in Iraq official US policy and set the course for the eventual invasion and occupation.</blockquote>
Also keep in mind the fact that the highly influential PNAC strategy document called Rebuilding America's Defenses was really no more than <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/etc/wolf.html">a warmed over version of the Cheney-Wolfowitz strategic defense document of 1992</a> that was rejected by ... well, everyone. They never gave up. They never do.<br />
<br />
It was this malign neoconservative influence that set everything in motion in Iraq and we are still paying the horrible price for that today. Al Qaeda existed apart from Saddam and would have been a threat regardless. But don't forget that the same people who pushed to invade Iraq for more than a decade forgot to put terrorism on its long list of threats. They always assumed that state power was the problem and they couldn't have been more wrong. As usual. And now we are mired in the Middle East even more deeply than before as the whole place burns down and nobody knows what's to take its place.<br />
<br />
The entire political establishment bears responsibility for this --- largely because they panicked after 9/11 and completely surrendered their good judgement and common sense. (That seems to be the reflexive response, unfortunately.) Still it's important to recall just who it was that planned and schemed and strategized for well over a decade to get the US militarily enmeshed in the region so deeply that it could never get out.<br />
<br />
This supremely confident group of failures is still out there, braying about American exceptionalism and the threat of the boogeyman coming to kill us all in our beds. And their influence is now fully woven into the national security state to the extent that nobody knows where they end and everyone else begins anymore. <i> But it doesn't change the fact that they have always been wrong about everything, </i>going all the way back to the 1970s when they were wrong about the Soviets and wrong about everything else. There has never been a more dangerously misguided faction in American politics. And yet, they just keep keeping on. <br />

There, gay students are beaten up-- not only by other students, but also by the school principals. Gay students are incarcerated in mental institutions, and they are "treated" with shock therapy. When released, they are required to continue such "treatment" at outpatient clinics. Other attempted "cures" include hypnosis and sedatives.

			<b>Out of the guns of babes</b><br />

<a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/11/gun_nuts_insane_new_crusade_how_they_explain_away_fatal_accidents_with_children/">This piece</a> by Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig at Salon about the "normalizing" of guns for children truly stunned me.  But it shouldn't.  After all, the whole point of Open Carry and the larger NRA agenda is the proliferation of guns and the legalization of killing with them (whether through accident or "self-defense.")  It's inexplicable why this nation is putting up with this sort of insanity but it seems to be working. <br />
<br />
She quotes this post from the Motherlode blog at the New York Times:<br />
<blockquote>
“This summer, three of my four children learned to shoot a .22. I relearned, too. I hadn’t fired a gun in years. To be honest, it was fun; like the many visitors who reviewed Bullets and Burgers on TripAdvisor before this tragedy, we enjoyed having a safe opportunity to do something my children had seen only on television or in video games[…]No matter how you feel about firearms and gun laws, we live in the country we live in. My neighbors have guns. Your neighbors have guns. Your guns may be locked up; the babysitter’s boyfriend may keep his on the seat of his car. At some point, some child is going to take my child or yours by the hand, open Mom’s closet or the trunk of Dad’s car, and say, “Look!” At that point, I don’t want my children to say, “Wow, let me see that.” I want them to shrug and say, “Whatever” and “Let’s go do something else.” (I actually want them to say: “Suzi, get away from there! That’s dangerous! We have to go tell your mom and mine right now!” But I’m realistic.)”</blockquote>
<br />
I spent a good part of my youth in Alaska. There are guns there, lots of them.  But to my recollection nobody ever casually left one on the seat of his car, nobody carried one in her waistband, nobody ostentatiously took them into public buildings. And everyone I knew who had guns treated them like the deadly weapons they were <i>and kept them away from children.</i> Many of these were people who hunted for food and actually lived in fear of dangerous wild animals.  And somehow they were able to get through life without teaching their kids that guns were just a lot of fun for their own sake and that casually leaving them around was perfectly normal.  It was not, not even among the most dedicated hunters and gun enthusiasts. <br />
<br />
The piece points out that this nonsensical view that kids will get bored with guns if they are exposed to them is like saying they'll get bored with amusement parks and ice cream. &nbsp;Sure it will, just like allowing kids to watch TV and play video games might lead them to be more likely to read books or clean their rooms.  It's always possible, of course, except that in the event that doesn't happen, video games and TV aren't going to kill them or someone else if they happen to drop the remote or get over-excited.<br />
<br />
Honestly, this is the sickest thing I've read about guns in a long time.  If the response to that horror of the 9 year old girl accidentally killing her instructor with an Uzi at "Bullets and Burgers" leads one to the conclusion that more kids should be handling guns, we are screwed. You've got to give the NRA credit --- they are the most insane lobby in the country and yet they are massively successful.<br />

Via Matt Duss whose <a href="http://prospect.org/article/fight-against-isil-obama-finds-himself-facing-michael-corleones-dilemma">piece on the President's speech</a> is well worth your time. It ends with this astute observation:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Speaking as a candidate in 2008 of his intention to withdraw from Iraq, Obama said, “I don't want to just end the war, but I want to end the mindset that got us into war in the first place.” It was a statement that inspired a great many progressives, this one included. But every day of his presidency has shown how hard that is to change that mindset, and he continues to be battered and buffeted by it. It’s also impossible to ignore the fact that, by constantly asserting vast executive authority for various anti-terrorism measures, from drone strikes to surveillance, Obama has also affirmed and strengthened that mindset. Like Corleone, he’s complicit in his own entrapment. And it’s something progressives will have to continue to struggle with long after his presidency ends.</blockquote><br />
<br />
That's the deep state at work. And the problem goes far beyond executive power. As I've been writing for some time, the ultimate answers lie in our commitment to empire (and our dependence on oil.) This is probably going to get worse as other resources become more precious due to climate change. Most Americans like being an empire with all that that implies. But the costs are mounting. <br />

			<p><b>Stupid is as stupid does</b></p>

<p>by Tom Sullivan</p>

<p>Many have commented on the recent Facebook posting by a Georgia Republican state senator. Fran Millar complained about siting an early voting location in a South DeKalb mall heavily used by African American residents, a location with large black churches nearby. Millar then made things worse in followup <a href="https://www.facebook.com/millar.ga/posts/718236501557052?comment_id=718266534887382&offset=50&total_comments=117">comments</a>:</p><blockquote>“I would prefer more educated voters than a greater increase in the number of voters. If you don't believe this is an efort [sic] to maximize Democratic votes pure and simple, then you are not a realist. This is a partisan stunt and I hope it can be stopped."</blockquote><p>That sentiment among Republicans goes back at least to Paul Weyrich's oldy-goldy, Goo-Goo syndrome speech from 1980.</p>

<div align="center"><iframe width="300" height="225" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WPsl_TuFdes" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen align="middle"></iframe></div>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/george-chidi">George Chidi</a>, a Georgia journalist writing in the Guardian, acknowledges the partisan flavor of the location decision, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/10/republicans-african-americans-voting-rights-southern-states">calling the plan</a> "a gigantic middle finger to Republicans intent on suppressing black voters." But if Republicans want to head off "the coming demographic Armageddon," Chidi believes, they might just want to start courting those black voters.</p><p>

Considering that early voting will begin in a few weeks, I want pivot to Millar's crack about preferring "more educated voters" to more voters generally. It's easy to sneer at Millar for (basically) calling constituents stupid. Besides being condescending, it's not the message to send people right before you ask for their votes.</p><p> 

Yet, I sometimes hear the same from lefties about poor, white, Republican voters. Occasionally, they just blurt out that voters are stupid. More often it's couched in a dog-whistle complaint about people voting against their best interests. Which, if you think about it, is just a more polite way of saying the same thing.</p><p>

As a field organizer in the South, I remind canvassers that, no, those voters are not stupid. They're <i><b>busy</b></i>. With jobs and kids and choir practice and soccer practice and church and PTA and Friday night football and more. Unlike political junkies, they don't keep up with issues. They don't have time for the issues. When they go to the polls they are voting to <i>hire someone</i> to keep up with the issues for them. And when they look at a candidate -- your candidate -- what they are really asking themselves is simple: "Is this someone I can trust?"</p><p>

One of my favorite southernisms is, "I wouldn't trust anyone my dog doesn't like." That, I caution canvassers, is how most Americans really vote, like it or not. And if you don't purge the thought, those "low information" voters? They will know you think they're stupid before you do. Right before you ask for their votes.</p><br>

			<b>Why The NFL Shit Won't Hit The Big Media Fan. Unless... </b>by Spocko<br />
<br />
Today the AP put out a story that the NFL in April received a DVD containing the surveillance video of Ray Rice slugging his fiancé. As you read the story and the follow up from the NFL you will see the personality of the organization shine through. You will also see the linguistic mark of hot-shot lawyers and PR crisis professionals. <br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PjVbypiUOHA?rel=0" width="420"></iframe>

<br />
<b><a href="http://deadspin.com/report-nfl-had-copy-of-ray-rice-tape-1633159819">Barry Petchesky at Deadspin </a></b>is doing great work on this story. From today:<br />
<br />
Update: The NFL has released the following statement in response to the AP's report.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
"We have no knowledge of this. We are not aware of anyone in our office who possessed or saw the video before it was made public on Monday. We will look into it."</blockquote>
Here's what Roger Goodell said last night to CBS when asked if anyone at the NFL had seen the tape before Monday:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
"No one in the NFL, to my knowledge, and I had been asked that same question and the answer to that is no. We were not granted that. We were told that was not something we would have access to. On multiple occasions, we asked for it. And on multiple occasions we were told no. I understand that there may be legal restrictions on them sharing that with us. And we've heard that from attorneys general and former attorneys general."</blockquote>
Weasel words for the win! I get tired of the troupe, "It's not the crime it's the cover up." As if all the would be Woodward and Bernstein's out in big media land will act now.<br />
<br />
The reality is that big media outlets won't be unleashing investigatory teams--if they even exist--unless they have no choice. &nbsp;And then it will be responding to what someone else has dug up, giving the NFL spokespeople multiple bites at the apple to comment.<br />
<br />
<b>There is one major media outlet that could dig deeper into the NFL lies. </b>Fox News.<br />
<br />
What would it take for that to happen? &nbsp;What if Hillary Clinton was brought in to give advice to the NFL? What did she know and when did she know it? How much was she paid for this advice? Who did she talk to? Can we get her to talk about it under oath so she can't lie about it? &nbsp;(Barring Hillary herself, did any of her staff advise the NFL?)<br />
<br />
That kind of info would put a partisan organization like Fox News in a bind. They want to make Clinton look bad, but it might hurt their big advertiser. Prediction? They would pass.<br />
<br />
<b>El Rushbo is the Real Victim Here</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
Who else normally would support the NFL and doesn't have them as a big advertiser? Rush Limbaugh.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to push the story against a company that has a right wing personality and is normally supported by the RW media, I would figure out a reason to give the RW media to pursue the story. &nbsp;They can't look like they are siding with women, that's a "liberal" issue. &nbsp;What or who can they be against? Elitism.<br />
<br />
The elites wouldn't let Rush buy into the club/franchise. This is his chance to get back at the people who snubbed him. He has the means, motive and opportunity to lash back at the NFL management. He might even pretend he cares about women in the process. His internal narrative?<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp;"You think <b>I'm</b> not good enough to be an owner because of <b>my </b>attitudes toward women? Well guess what? <b>You </b>aren't good enough to be owners because <b>you </b>rejected <b>me</b>. I'm going to expose your lies out of spite."</blockquote>
I don't think he will do this, he still thinks he can get back into the club. But it would be fun to see them fight each other. Rush won't be able to burnish his image with women now, but he would be able to drag some NFL people down with him.<br />
<br />
Now if I can &nbsp;just get a call into Smeadly...<br>

In advance of the president's big speech tonight, probably wise to get a good lay of the land among the Villagers. Having watched the shows today briefly, I think Ron Fournier's sage advice is fairly <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/10/d_c_s_most_ridiculous_pundit_does_it_again_ron_fournier_pretends_to_be_serious_is_really_a_troll/">representative:</a></div>

We’re angry and scared now. We want to fight. History suggests that we will rally behind the commander in chief in the immediate aftermath of tonight’s address. But it wasn’t that long ago—a matter of weeks, really—when “war-weary” was the go-to adjective for “Americans.” We will grow weary again, and Obama may need to draw on tonight’s speech to remind people, <i>“This is why we must fight.”</i></blockquote>
That pretty much sums it up: We must fight! To hell with all that pansy strategy talk, the president has to be a decider and accomplish the mission, whatever it is, and dammit we have to stick with it forever! Fight, fight, fight. &nbsp;(He's right that the people will likely rally --- the propaganda from all sides has done its work.)<br />

Andrew Sullivan is one of the few people who has revisited his support for Bush's warmongering and is much more skeptical this time.

A strategy predicated on the existence of an effective moderate Syrian rebel force is doomed to fail. Instead, the focus should be on shaping the environment in ways which will encourage the emergence of a politically legitimate and more effectively unified opposition.

The emerging regional strategy offers perhaps the first opportunity to unify these efforts to build rather than divide the Syrian opposition.

It should be understood instead as buying the time to shape an environment in which such a transition could become plausible. … The longer-term goal should be to translate this anti-ISIS tacit accord into an effective agreement by the external backers of both Asad and the rebels on a de-escalation of the conflict.

Obama appears to envisage arming and training the “moderates” of the Free Syrian Army, who have consistently been pushed to the margins by al-Qaeda offshoots and affiliates. Private billionaires in the Gulf will continue to support ISIL or its rival, Jabhat al-Nusra (the Succor Front, which has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda).<span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></blockquote>

Strengthening yet another guerrilla group will, again, likely prolong the fighting. Moreover, in the past two years, Free Syrian Army moderate groups have gone radical and joined Nusrah or ISIL at an alarming rate.

In Iraq, while giving the Kurds and the Iraqi army close air support against ISIL has already borne fruit when the local forces were defending their ethnic enclaves, it hasn’t helped either largely Kurdish forces or the (largely Shiite) Iraqi army take Sunni Arab territory. Several campaigns against Tikrit have failed. The only thing worse than this failure might be success. Success would mean smart phone video making its way to YouTube showing US bombing urban residential buildings full of Sunni Arab families in support for a motley crew of Kurdish (non-Arab) fighters and Shiite troops and militiamen. Helping such forces take Tikrit, the birthplace of Saddam Hussein, would make for a very bad image in the Sunni world.</blockquote>

For the United States, the best possible outcome would be for the militants to withdraw from their illusory state in Iraq to bases in Syria, where they might wither in the face of strengthened Syrian rebels; ideally, the rebels would also bring an end to the Assad regime in Damascus. Iraq and Syria, with their multicultural societies, would then have breathing room to incubate inclusive governments. That’s the goal, anyway. The worst outcome would be another open-ended, treasury-sapping, coffin-producing, and increasingly unpopular war that fails to erase ISIS or resurrect Iraq. It might even, in time, become a symbolic graveyard of American greatness—as it was for the French and the British. The Middle East has a proven record of sucking us in and spitting us out<span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></blockquote>

Sullivan places his hopes in a spirited Senate debate,. &nbsp;I hope there is one but I seriously doubt it will make any difference. Once this train picks up speed there never any stopping it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
I must also say that I'm more sympathetic to the President here than some. I think he has resisted the pull of the bipartisan foreign policy national security establishment more than any president I can remember. That is not nothing. The Deep State is what really runs the world and it gets what it wants.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I see this, by the way, in contrast to the domestic economic establishment which is certainly run by elites, some of the same ones, but where I think the president actually has more room to move the dial. &nbsp;The executive branch actually does run the agencies and the people are far less easily manipulated. (See: social security cuts and grand bargains.) But on national security all it takes is some hysteria from Lindsay Graham, a couple of scary videos and a good dollop of "America-Fuck Yeah!" and the public is on board with some super-power ultra-violence (aimed at faceless foreigners, of course.) If it suits the national security establishment to unleash that beast the president doesn't have much power to stop it, "commander-in-chief" be damned.&nbsp;</div>

He gave it the &nbsp;good-old college try though, I'll give him that. The good news is that he's unlikely to pump his fist and say "feel's good!" before his speech tonight. &nbsp;Not that it matters.<br />

If you would like to see the true success of the anti-abortion zealots just <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/10/gofundme_bans_all_content_relating_to_abortion_but_leaves_antiabortion_campaigns_active/">get a load of this:</a><br />
<br />
<blockquote>Last week, crowdfunding platform GoFundMe pulled a campaign to raise money for an Illinois woman’s abortion. In a message to the woman, identified only as Bailey, GoFundMe said that the fundraiser was not “appropriate” for the site because it contained “subject matter that GoFundMe would rather not be associated with.” In an earlier comment to Salon on its decision to shutdown the campaign, a “customer happiness” representative said that each review is handled on a “case-by-case basis” and, “In this particular case, GoFundMe determined that the fundraising campaign titled ‘Bailey’s Abortion Fund’ would be removed from the site.”<br />
<br />
But as of this week, the site will no longer handle campaigns to fund abortion on a case-by-case basis. According to GoFundMe’s updated guidelines (“What’s Not Allowed on GoFundMe“), abortion fundraisers are banned without exception. In addition to prohibiting crowdfunded abortion campaigns, “content associated with or relating to” abortion is also banned. This information is listed under the headline, “Termination of Life,” which is the same language used by antiabortion activists who believe in fetal personhood. (The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists defines abortion as “a procedure that is done to end a pregnancy.”) In fact, GoFundMe has a separate section outlining which medical campaigns are prohibited, but abortion is not listed in it.<br />
<br />
But the ban on abortion-related content has not been neutrally applied. As of Wednesday afternoon, there are still pages of antiabortion campaigns active on the site. It seems that you can’t use GoFundMe to raise money for anything related to abortion — unless you’re campaigning to ban abortion.<br />
<br />
One campaign that raised $1,510 of its $1,700 goal described its mission as “Advocating for Women & Girls at the UN,” and informed potential donors, “Your donation will help spread the word of more atrocities that take place in American abortion clinics.”</blockquote><br />
This is not all that unusual.  Advocating for reproductive rights is "controversial."  Advocating for "life" isn't.  That's one of the big success stories of the past couple of decades of movement conservatism. <br />
<br />
This is a battle that people are sick of fighting, I get that.  Why won't women just figure this out and move on already?  But this is an issue that personally affects the freedom of half the population of the planet and indirectly impacts everyone. It's as fundamental to human agency in this life as it gets. And those who want to restrict that agency and limit the choices and ultimate freedom of women are not losing the battle.  They're winning it. One baby step at a time. <br />

Why should <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/massachusetts-mayor-threat-gun">this</a> be a problem?  According to the gun proliferation advocates carrying a gun is a perfectly normal thing to do and nobody should feel that it's being used as a form of intimidation, especially not in a political sense:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>[Councilman] Carreia signed the petition filed by town residents to recall the mayor [Flanagan] over tax hikes and garbage fees. Flanagan, who has challenged the petition's validity, allegedly asked Carreia to call the Fall River Herald News and say he was intimidated into signing the recall petition.<br />
<br />
According to Carreia, Flanagan took a gun out of the center console in the SUV and told the councilman that he never leaves home without his firearm.<br />
<br />
"Obviously when he took out a gun, the whole thing escalated," Carreia told the Boston Herald on Monday. "This is the mayor. I don’t know what he’s capable of. He didn’t forewarn me he had a gun. I thought, ‘This is ridiculous. This is crazy.’ There’s no doubt in my mind there was intimidation being used. No doubt."<br />
<br />
However, Flanagan said that the gun was in his waistband and that he never took it out. He claims he only showed Carreia the gun and was trying to show Carreia how to protect himself.</blockquote><br />
That's right.  He was just showing him his gun and giving him some "instruction" on how one might protect ones self.  Just like those nice "good guys" who carry guns into stores and restaurants aren't in any way intimidating people.  They're just exercising their right to bear arms --- and if you happen to feel intimidated by that, well, that's your problem. <br />
<br />
<i>Nice little free speech you've got there ... be a shame if anything happened to it.</i><br />

<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show">On the necessity of having a congressional debate on ISIS strategy</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>We have a great and recent history of making terrible decisions. Terrible, short-sighted, poorly argued and in some cases based on false premises decisions."</blockquote><br />
Also too, this:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Yes, some of the U.S. aircraft that are conducting these now 153 airstrikes are drones, so there is no pilot at risk, the the other aircraft that we've got over there are fighter jets and what they describe as attack aircraft. All of those have pilots and crews. And for some reason we've decided not to call what they're doing "combat." But the people they are attacking have some capacity to shoot down aircraft that are attacking them. They've got heavy anti-aircraft weapons. <br />
<br />
So it might be politically convenient to say you support airstrikes, but not combat, or airstrikes but not "boots-on-the-ground. But there are now more than 1100 U.S. personnel in Iraq to support the airstrikes that are already happening. And god forbid if American aircraft start getting shot down by this militant group with their anti-aircraft artillery, then you better believe there are going to be boots on the grounds, and quickly...</blockquote><br />
Her whole segment is worth watching. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there is almost no chance that the congress would not approve military action against the barbaric monsters who beheaded two Americans. The president is out there saying that he's going whether they like it or not which may just be enough to taunt them into doing it --- especially since the polling makes it clear that the American people back the play.<br />
<br />
So I think the "Kingston" strategy of forcing the president to make the decision so they can criticize him either way may no longer be operative. It's always possible that they can delay action until the election but if history informs us of anything, a call to arms will almost always be met with enthusiastic support among most politicians trying to be re-elected.<br />
<br />
But the debate is still worth having.It tends to clarify things.  And politicians <i>should</i> be on the record when it comes to war. I just wouldn't get my hopes up that it will change anything,.<br />
