It <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/12\/alibaba-is-on-track-to-become-the-biggest-u-s-ipo-ever-here-are-three-charts-you-need-to-see\/\">hopes to raise<\/a> more than $20 billion.<\/p>\n<p>How Silicon Valley views Alibaba is another matter altogether. While respectful of Alibaba   s success in China and all that capital it shortly will have in its coffers, the U.S. tech scene views Alibaba as nearly a non-entity, now and for the foreseeable future, for potential competition in its core markets. At the same time, it sees Alibaba as already an active sparring partner for investments and, perhaps, acquisitions of tech startups.<\/p>\n<p>Like its major competitors Tencent and Baidu, Alibaba made its name\u2014and its profits\u2014in China. Non-Chinese revenues are about 10% of its total today, however, particularly coming from AliExpress, its global e-commerce business. According to Alibaba   s IPO prospectus, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1577552\/000119312514333674\/d709111df1a.htm\">which you can read yourself<\/a> if you have a few spare hours, Russia, Brazil and the U.S. are the highest-growth regions for AliExpress. (The other day <em>The Wall Street Journal<\/em> nicely covered Alibaba   s <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/articles\/chinas-alibaba-draws-brazilian-bargain-shoppers-1410555882\">foray into Brazil<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Operating in the U.S. will be a different story. Silicon Valley executives absolutely are taking Alibaba seriously. But they tend to note that Alibaba and its peers thrived in a country that put its thumb on the scales in favor of Chinese Internet companies while keeping U.S. competitors at a distance. Google, Facebook, and eBay all have had their problems in China, while the Chinese giants haven   t yet really tried their hands meaningfully in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to investments, however, Alibaba has been making its presence felt. It hired Michael Zeisser, a seasoned dealmaking executive from John Malone   s Liberty Media, to run its U.S.-based corporate development. (It   s hard to imagine a Chinese biz-dev executive <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zeisser.com\/\">putting his email <\/a>on the web to solicit investments.) It also has hired seasoned public-relations as well as investor-relations talent in Jim Wilkinson, a former press aide for Henry Paulson at the U.S. Treasury, and Jane Penner, a Google veteran. These U.S.-based hires undoubtedly were mostly about ensuring a smooth IPO, but they also will be available for any future push on U.S. soil.<\/p>\n<p>The investments themselves are varied and high dollar value, and each can be viewed as targeting a potential non-Chinese competitor. Alibaba plunked down more than $200 million for a  % stake in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shoprunner.com\/about\/\">Shoprunner<\/a>, the Amazon Prime competitor headed by ex-Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson. More recently it joined several U.S. venture capital firms in investing in Lyft, which presumably buttresses its China-based taxi strategy that <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/08\/ubers-challenge-in-china\/\">Miguel Helft wrote about last week<\/a> on Fortune.com. (Taxis essentially are a payments play to Alibaba, putting it in potential conflict with the likes of eBay and now Apple.) Alibaba took a $120-million stake in San Francisco game developer Kabam, which already had a studio in China.<\/p>\n<p>For its IPO, Alibaba is coming to the U.S., its current best opportunity to raise capital. Watching how it spend that money in the U.S. will an interesting next chapter.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"1\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3780601627001-1\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3780601627001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1D90KGJ\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp gdfp_req=1&amp impl=s&amp output=xml_vast2&amp iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/finance_bc&amp sz=1000x1&amp cust_params=tags%3Dalibaba%2Calibabagroup%2Cipo%2Cmarkettrends%2Cstephengandel%26ch%3Dfinance%26topic%3Dmarkettrends&amp unviewed_position_start=1&amp correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences() \n\t\t\t<\/script>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 01:50:10","updated":"2014-09-15 01:50:10","minute":"1:50 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/alibaba-silicon-valley-ipo\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/alibaba-silicon-valley-ipo\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/alibaba-jack-ma-bloomberg.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Bloomberg\u2014Getty Images","caption":"Alibaba Group CEO Jack Ma.","attach_id":788169},"short_title":"How Silicon Valley sees Alibaba","excerpt":"A competitor?

The article below was originally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3373185\/roger-goodell-resignation-pressure-ray-rice\/\" target=\"_blank\">Time.com<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>BY Nolan Feeney, TIME<\/p>\n<p>National Football League commissioner Roger Goodell is facing mounting calls for his resignation amid the league\u2019s handling of a recently published video tape of Ray Rice, which shows the Baltimore Ravens running back knocking his fianc\u00e9e unconscious in an elevator.<\/p>\n<p>Rice was given a two-game suspension in July for violating the league\u2019s personal-conduct policy after he was arrested on charges related to domestic violence for the incident. In August, Goodell apologized for the leniency of the punishment and announced <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3210301\/the-easiest-call-of-roger-goodells-career\/\" target=\"_blank\">stricter punishments<\/a> for abusers, but two events put him back in the hot seat last week: first, security footage of the actual assault that surfaced on TMZ  and second, an Associated Press report that law enforcement <a href=\"http:\/\/bigstory.ap.org\/article\/ap-newsbreak-source-says-rice-video-sent-nfl\" target=\"_blank\">had sent the footage to the NFL the footage five months ago<\/a>. Goodell has said that nobody in the organization saw the video footage until last week.<\/p>\n<p>But women\u2019s groups have mounted a growing campaign for Goodell\u2019s resignation. UltraViolet, a women\u2019s-rights organization, announced plans to fly planes with banners featuring the message \u201c#GoodellMustGo\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2014-09-12\/-goodell-must-go-banners-to-fly-above-nfl-stadiums-on-game-day.html\" target=\"_blank\">over three different NFL stadiums on Sunday<\/a>, Bloomberg News reports. The planes are expected fly for two hours over stadiums in San Francisco, Cleveland and East Rutherford, N.J., before the facilities\u2019 no-fly-zone rules kick in an hour before games begin. Another plane is scheduled to fly over a stadium in Indianapolis on Monday ahead of another NFL game there that night.<\/p>\n<p>Terry O\u2019Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women, said in a statement earlier in the week that Goodell\u2019s resignation was the only solution for the league to \u201ctransform the culture of violence against women that pervades the NFL,\u201d citing the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/32 2 \/ray-mcdonald-arrested-domestic-violence-49ers\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ray McDonald<\/a> (arrested in August on felony domestic-violence charges) and the Carolina Panthers\u2019 <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3329416\/greg-hardy-nfl-domestic-violence\/\" target=\"_blank\">Greg Hardy<\/a> (arrested in May for assaulting an ex-girlfriend) as other examples. Hardy had been due to play for the Panthers Sunday, but was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2014\/09\/14\/us\/nfl-domestic-violence-greg-hardy\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">placed on the inactive list<\/a> shortly before the game.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe NFL sets the example for college, high school, middle school and even elementary school football programs,\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/espn.go.com\/nfl\/story\/_\/id\/11500445\/terry-oneill-president-national-organization-women-calls-nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-resign\" target=\"_blank\">O\u2019Neill said in a statement<\/a>, according to ESPN. \u201cAnd the example it is setting right now is simply unacceptable. New leadership must come in with a specific charge to transform the culture of violence against women that pervades the NFL. That\u2019s the only way to restore honor and integrity to the country\u2019s most lucrative and popular pastime.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A number of lawmakers have also weighed in. Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota <a href=\"http:\/\/thehill.com\/blogs\/in-the-know\/in-the-know\/217126-dem-senator-nfl-commissioner-should-consider-resigning\" target=\"_blank\">told the <em>Hill<\/em><\/a> that Goodell should \u201cseriously\u201d consider resignation. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called for \u201cstronger stiffer penalties against criminal assault and domestic violence\u201d no matter who was in charge of the league, while Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland \u201cwasn\u2019t prepared\u201d to say whether Goodell should resign but called for the NFL \u201cto be a leader\u201d in addressing domestic violence.<\/p>\n<p>The hashtag #GoodellMustGo has also taken off on Twitter, where an advertisement for CoverGirl\u2019s NFL line with the slogan \u201cGet your game face on!\u201d was modified to show a model with a black eye, <a href=\"http:\/\/ftw.usatoday.com\/2014\/09\/photoshop-nfl-covergirl-model-black-eye-twitter\" target=\"_blank\"><em>USA Today<\/em> reports<\/a>, and widely shared.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">John Mara, the president and CEO of the New York Giants, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/sports\/football\/john-mara-supports-roger-goodell-cries-commish-resignation-article-1.1935194\" target=\"_blank\">said in a supportive statement Wednesday<\/a> that Goodell took responsibility for Rice\u2019s initial two-game suspension and had made a positive change in the league: \u201cOur policy now on domestic violence has been strengthened.

We now have a strong partnership with anti-domestic violence groups, and we will be a better league for it going forward.\u201d He also said the NFL had made \u201crepeated requests\u201d to obtain

Jersey union complaint on pension 'ethics' is full of holes","content":"<p>The New Jersey State AFL-CIO last week filed an 11-page complaint with the State Ethics Commission, referring to what it called  8220 a disturbing pattern of big contributions to Christie for Governor or Republican organizations by firms handpicked to manage hundreds of millions in state pension funds. 8221  If the union   s goal was to generate headlines that would embarrass a political foe, then the AFL-CIO did its job. If it wanted to make credible allegations of wrongdoing, then it failed miserably.<\/p>\n<p>At issue are New Jersey laws that prevent that state   s public pension system from investing in certain types of funds whose managers have contributed to in-state political candidates or parties during the 24 months prior to receiving the commitment. In other words,    pay-to-play    restrictions designed to prevent pension officials (and their bosses) from giving new business to political patrons.<\/p>\n<p>AFL-CIO believes it has found five examples of such behavior. The problem is that at least three of them involve investment decisions made <em>before<\/em> Christie entered office. Moreover, the political contributions came years after the pension   s investments were made, and were made by individuals who don   t actually fall under the rule   s purview.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the complaint cites:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Gleacher and Company, which manages such monies even though William Sapoch, who is listed as an investment management professional with the firm, gave $3,800 in December 2012 to Christie for Governor.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nj.gov\/treasury\/doinvest\/pdf\/AnnualReport\/2013-NJPensionFund.pdf\">state investment records<\/a>, the only state pension monies managed by Gleacher &amp  Co. relate to Gleacher Mezzanine Fund II, a private debt fund that was raised back in 2006. Hard to imagine how a political donation <em>six years later<\/em> would have impacted that decision (which was made during the Corzine administration). It also is worth noting that William Sapoch appears to have been a financial advisor with Gleacher who never worked on the mezzanine business  8212  a business that actually spun out from Gleacher (and renamed itself Arrowhead Mezzanine) back in 2010.<\/p>\n<p>Here   s another:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>JP Morgan, a $3,800 contribution from Robert F. Cummings, listed as the vice chairman for Investment Banking, in January 2013 to Christie for Governor and a $15,000 to the State Republican Party by Greg Onken, who is listed as a managing director and financial advisor.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>New Jersey has multiple investments in JP Morgan-related securities but most of it is in publicly-traded equities and bonds that do not fall under the New Jersey statute (because these are passive holdings that do not involve the bank  8220 recommending investment management decisions 8221 ). The only exception is a venture capital fund investment called JP Morgan Venture Capital III, which was raised in 2006 and was not managed by either of the aforementioned JP Morgan professionals (Cummings didn   t even join JPMorgan until late 2010, while Onken is a private wealth manager).<\/p>\n<p>The one AFL-CIO example that does hold water is a 2011 investment in a venture capital fund managed by General Catalyst Partners, which had a part-timer who had made a $10,000 contribution to the NJ Republican State Committee just months earlier. That deal has been under investigation since this past May, while<em> Fortune<\/em> reported <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/nj-unloads-bakerpay-to-play\/\">earlier today<\/a> that the New Jersey Division of Investments has sold its interest in the fund. AFL-CIO also mentions State Street, in which New Jersey appears to have briefly invested in via a money market fund. It is unclear when that investment began and ended.<\/p>\n<p>But it gets worse. Here is what AFL-CIO wrote in its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.njaflcio.org\/nj_afl_cio_files_ethics_complaint_over_pay_to_play_in_pension_investments\">press release<\/a> announcing the complaint:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Many of the state\u2019s relationships with Wall Street firms coincide with generous political contributions, even though state ethics rules require a two-year lag before a donor can be a pension investor. For example, an employee of the Blackstone Group donated $10,000 to the NJ Republican State Committee in 2011, the same year new investment business was being proposed for the firm.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Blackstone employee being referred to here in Anthony Grillo, who actually left the firm back in 2005 (according to both a press release and contemporaneous media coverage). This example was not included in the actual complaint, but remains in the press release posted on the union   s website.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to in-state contributions, AFL-CIO also suggests that several hedge fund managers violated New Jersey law by committing to national political parties. Except that they didn   t.<\/p>\n<p>AFL-CIO seems to be relying on a March 2014 rules change that specifically exempted contributions to national candidates or parties from pay-to-play restrictions, whereas the earlier law was vague on the issue. What the union seems to have missed, however, was a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nj.gov\/treasury\/doinvest\/pdf\/ContributionPolicy\/PolicyAdoptedFeb06.pdf\">2006 opinion<\/a> from the NJ State Investment Council (then under Democratic Party control) that says, in part:  8220 Federal contributions were beyond the intended scope of the Council\u2019s regulations. Therefore, it was clarified that the Council\u2019s policy is limited to state committees. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>Finally there is the issue of Bob Grady, the Christie-appointed NJ State Investment Council chairman who once used to work for The Carlyle Group (a giant private equity firm that received investments from New Jersey both before and after Christie took office). The AFL-CIO contents that Grady stands to profit from investments made in Carlyle funds after he left the firm in 2009  8212  a specious claim we debunked <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/04\/17\/revealed-pando-smears-ex-carlyle-pro-bob-grady\/\">earlier this year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The AFl-CIO has not yet responded to a request for comment on the issue of investment decision timing vs. political contribution timing. It also is worth noting that the union has a representative serving on the NJ State Investment Committee.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sign up for Dan   s daily newsletter on deals and dealmakers: <a href=\"http:\/\/gettermsheet.com\">Get Term Sheet<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 02:30:29","updated":"2014-09-15 02:30:29","minute":"2:30 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/union-complaint-on-nj-pension-ethics-is-full-of-holes\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/union-complaint-on-nj-pension-ethics-is-full-of-holes\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/455206696.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photo by Matt Rainey\u2014Getty Images","caption":"","attach_id":"788172"},"short_title":"","excerpt":"<p>Before the AFL-CIO files another ethics report to embarrass Chris Christie, it should double-check its dates.

It\u2019s a place in need of some investment. The trains run slow because of its aging tracks. The city\u2019s real estate needs a makeover. The fishing industry is lagging on equipment. But it\u2019s a town with a thriving community, and Ledoux has some ideas: To grow imports of Dungeness crab and Albacore tuna, Coos Bay has to expand the capacity of its sluggish port. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to upgrade our import and export terminals in order to move container ships in and out of our harbor a little faster,\u201d said Ledoux, a former president of Coos Bay\u2019s chamber of commerce.<\/p>\n<p>But Ledoux, whose Fisherman\u2019s Wharf market sells local seafood, thinks Coos Bay has a shot in a new competition that just might make some of that investment come to life. Ledoux is assembling a group from the city\u2019s nonprofits, business chambers and other groups to formulate a business plan and apply for the America\u2019s Best Communities competition, a $10 million contest that kicked off this week as a partnership between Frontier Communications and DISH Network to stimulate growth and revitalization in small cities and towns.<\/p>\n<p>If Ledoux\u2019s team is successful, they stand a chance at winning a multi-million dollar prize, which Ledoux says they plan to invest in updating Coos Bay\u2019s infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>The contest, the first of its kind, is aimed at cities and small towns with a population of 9,500 to 80,000 in the 27 states Frontier serves, and is intended to reward the communities that have the best ideas to build, sustain and grow their local economies. The contest kicked off last week with a launch event in Gardnerville, Nevada 8211 as well as smaller events in markets including Charleston West Virginia, Terre Haute, Indiana and Dallas, Pennsylvania 8211 but Frontier is hoping that thousands of communities will take part in the initiative.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a rare spotlight on rural communities at a time when cities are all the rage. But Frontier is deeply rooted in the rural markets of the U.S. Maggie Wilderotter, CEO of Frontier, sees the competition as an important catalyst to improve many towns and communities in the U.S., especially the smaller-sized markets that often get overlooked. \u201cOne of the things that we are trying to do is to create a multiplier effect,\u201d said Wilderotter. \u201cSo with our $10 million investment, you sort of get this rising tide to lift all boats.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Under the terms of the contest, communities have until January 2015 to pitch their business plans. From there, 50 communities will be shortlisted, and each one will be granted $35,000 as \u201cseed investment.\u201d For the next seven months, those 50 will fine tune their ideas and submit their final proposals in September 2015. In early 2016, eight finalists will be awarded $100,000 each to put their plans into practice. And lastly, the top three winners from that group of finalists will receive a total of $6 million in October 2017. (Smaller sponsors will donate the remaining funds for equipment including GoPro cameras, which will be given to communities to document their meetings.)<\/p>\n<p>Wilderotter herself is a champion of small markets, telling Fortune that when she feels \u201cdepressed\u201d in fast-paced Washington D.C., where she currently lives, she likes to visit her smaller, more laid-back markets, which she says inspire her. \u201cI see how the local governments where they have mayors and city councils that work side by side with businesses and communities,\u201d she said. \u201cI see these tight-knit communities where people know each other and help each other.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That focus on small communities led Frontier to partner with DISH, the satellite television and broadband service provider that serves 14 million subscribers across the US, including in many remote areas of the country. DISH CEO Joseph Clayton told Fortune he feels the small communities across the US have been the backbone of America. \u201cThey just need some investment to bring innovation to the forefront,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The two companies hired an outside firm to create the contest, and as part of the research process, representatives from both companies visited rural communities in Michigan, Oregon and Illinois, where they saw a lot of promise\u2014young people speaking passionately about innovative ideas to better their communities\u2014but projects lagged in the absence of funding.<\/p>\n<p>It was important to the companies that the contest reward communities that are designing their own projects with their own people. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be heavy handed,\u201d says Steve Crosby, senior vice president of corporate communications for Frontier.<\/p>\n<p>While going through the city of Coos Bay, the research team met Ledoux, the seafood seller. They asked him who would benefit more from the contest, governments or business communities. Ledoux vouched for business\u2014\u201cbecause entrepreneurs are very good at taking $1 and turning it into $10.\u201d The prize will be awarded to community development ideas with a business focus, like renovating a public park and hosting a concert there, or opening cafes with bookshops.<\/p>\n<p>With Oregon the top destination for intra-state moves last year, the business prospects of the entire state have increased, which means more potential business for both Frontier and DISH. Indeed, by strengthening the tax base of these smaller cities and towns and improving the quality of life, it\u2019s also injecting capital into areas with the hope of turning them into growth markets for both companies.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe think this is good business for us,\u201d said Wilderotter. \u201cIt\u2019s in our best interest.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a small city like Coos Bay, the arrival of new residents has already brought some change. Breweries are popping up. The timber and fishing industries are drawing new businesses. If Coos Bay ends up as one of America\u2019s Best Communities, it could be a game changer. Says Ledoux: \u201cThere is a very real chance that we   ll have necessary resources to accomplish our dreams. 8221 <\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 12:52:15","updated":"2014-09-15 12:52:15","minute":"12:52 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/frontier-and-dish-put-a-10-million-spotlight-on-small-towns\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/frontier-and-dish-put-a-10-million-spotlight-on-small-towns\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/184088184.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photo by Michal Bryc\u2014Getty Images","caption":"","attach_id":"784468"},"short_title":"The two communications companies launch a competition for \"America's Best Communities\" ","excerpt":"","authors":[{"id":"555574","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/mehboob-jeelani\/","name":"Mehboob Jeelani","twitter":"jeelanireports","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img alt='' src='http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/?s=59 038 d=identicon 038 r=G' class='avatar avatar-59' height='59' width='59' \/>","bio":"","title":"","company":""}],"sections":[{"term_id":4236,"name":"Management","slug":"management","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46727,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and advice on management, leadership, jobs, careers, CEOs and anyone who aspires to the C-suite.","parent":0,"count":6106,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":3225,"name":"Real Estate","slug":"real-estate","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":47384,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":99,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":10585,"name":"Small Business","slug":"small-business","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46732,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News about how to grow, build, and sustain your small business - news from Fortune Magazine about small business.","parent":0,"count":252,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":1,"name":"Uncategorized","slug":"uncategorized","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":1,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":18,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Management","slug":"management","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/category\/management\/"},"tags":[{"term_id":4253322,"name":"The New Metropolis","slug":"the-new-metropolis","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":110726,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":9,"filter":"raw"}],"primary_tag":{"name":"The New Metropolis","slug":"the-new-metropolis","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/the-new-metropolis\/"},"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"Matt Ledoux is a 34-year-old seafood entrepreneur in Coos Bay, Oregon, a small coastal town of 16,000 people.

The acquisition will also bring Neiman into direct competition with global online luxury retailers like Net-a-Porter and The Corner, which is owned by Italian e-commerce site Yoox Group. Neiman Marcus is also buying Theresa   s flagship store in central Munich, as part of a deal whose terms were not disclosed.<\/p>\n<p>Neiman, with annual sales nearing the $5 billion mark, already serves customers living in some 120 countries through its websites. But its efforts have not been without setbacks: last year, Neiman closed a warehouse in China that it had opened to more quickly fill orders made on its China e-commerce site, saying it would instead resume filling those orders from the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>The Mytheresa.com deal takes it up a notch for the company, whose chief executive, Karen Katz, has made no secret of her international ambitions for Neiman.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis acquisition is an important component of our long-range strategy to more broadly serve affluent customers around the world. Mytheresa has a very nice foothold in <span class=\"mandelbrot_refrag\"><a class=\"mandelbrot_refrag\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wwd.com\/news?region=europe&amp lc=int_mb_1001\">Europe<\/a><\/span> and a developing foothold in Asia, 8221  Katz told <em>Women   s Wear Daily.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The Mytheresa.com follows on the heels of Neiman   s announcement earlier this month that it was finally opening a flagship store in Manhattan in 2018. That store, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/03\/after-more-than-a-century-neiman-marcus-plans-first-flagship-store-in-new-york\/\">Katz told<\/a> <em>Fortune<\/em>, will play a key role in building Neiman   s international clientele.<\/p>\n<p>Neiman will operate Mytheresa.com as a separate business unit, much as its Bergdorf Goodman store is run separately from the Neiman Marcus stores.<\/p>\n<p>Mytheresa.com was launched in 2006 and has, along with the flagship, annual sales of about $130 million. It sells clothes, shoes, handbags and accessories by some 170 international top designers such as Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, Valentino, among others. The product range includes clothing, shoes, bags and accessories. Around 500 new products go online every week. About two-thirds of Mytheresa\u2019s revenue comes from outside of Germany.<\/p>\n<p>While retail in many major markets has been sluggish, international luxury continues to offer stores the best growth prospects: worldwide sales of personal luxury goods (i.e. clothes, shoes but not travel) were estimated to to rise 4-6% in 2014 Bain &amp  Co and Italian luxury industry association Altagamma projected in a study released in May.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 10:20:43","updated":"2014-09-15 10:20:43","minute":"10:20 AM

the fact that it   s not actually ready, and won   t be until sometime next year  8212  is that it tries to do too much.<\/p>\n<p>Which, as Ben Thompson and James Allworth point out in an <a href=\"http:\/\/exponent.fm\/episode-017-lets-end-it-there\/\">Exponent<\/a> podcast recorded last Friday, is another way of saying that Apple doesn   t really know what the Apple Watch is

not in a nice way  8212  recalling the moment in the presentation when 1,000 tiny photos are squeezed onto a 1.7-inch screen.  8220 How on earth, 8221  he asks,  8220 did that make it into the keynote? 8221 <\/p>\n<p>Allworth had a similar reaction to watch   s home screen, which presents the user with a choice of up to 64 apps.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 I looked at that interface, and there are all these tiny little buttons, 8221  he says.  8220 That   s nuts! It feels like they didn   t say no enough when they developed this device. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>Rather than show the watch doing things better done on a phone (such as displaying photos or zooming in on the image of a map) Apple would have been better served, Thomson suggests, by boiling the presentation down to four or five things that can only be done on a watch (such as signaling map directions with taps on the wrist).<\/p>\n<p> 8220 I didn   t get the impression from the keynote, 8221  Thompson concludes,  8220 that there is a deep sense [at Apple] of what need is being met. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>The podcast is Exponent Episode 17:  8220 <a href=\"http:\/\/exponent.fm\/episode-017-lets-end-it-there\/\">Let   s End It There<\/a>. 8221  The Apple Watch discussion begins at 9:30.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Follow <b>Philip Elmer-DeWitt<\/b> on Twitter at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/philiped\"><span class=\"s1\">@philiped<\/span><\/a>.

And television content is increasingly available on the Web, through services like Netflix <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"NFLX\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/nflx\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">NFLX<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and iTunes, Amazon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/amzn\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AMZN<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, and Hulu Plus. That\u2019s all leading to growing populations of cord-cutters\u2014people who cobble together a package of those services and unplug their cable lines\u2014and  8220 cord-nevers, 8221  millennials who have grown up watching video on the Web and never bothered to sign up for cable.<\/p>\n<p>But much of the hottest TV content remains locked up in the cable bundle, the large packet of channels sold by cable and satellite TV companies that include piles of programming that consumers never watch.<\/p>\n<p>And while cord-cutting is putting pressure on content providers to look at alternatives to the traditional, and lucrative, cable packages\u2014last week for instance, Viacom <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"VIA.B\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/via-b\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">VIA.B<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> agreed to let Sony <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"SNE\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/sne\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">SNE<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> carry channels like Nickelodeon and MTV for its planned Web television service\u2014the cable bundle has remained stubbornly intact so far.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNone of the new services look like a \u2018silver bullet\u2019 in the industry,\u201d says Ian Olgeirson, a senior analyst at SNL Kagan. \u201cNone is a killer package that is going to cause the collapse of the multichannel bundle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Devices are not the obstacle. The market has been flooded with gadgets that can deliver Internet video content. There\u2019s Apple TV, which has sold more than 20 units, according to Cook. There\u2019s also Amazon\u2019s Fire TV, Google\u2019s Chromecast, TiVo, Roku and scores of \u201csmart\u201d TVs. To broaden their appeal, several of these device makers have improved their interfaces, for instance, allowing users to browse several streaming services at once, rather than one by one.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s all pushed programmers, however slowly, to look for ways to make their most prized content more accessible. Last week, for instance, Time Warner <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"TWX\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/twx\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">TWX<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> CEO Jeff Bewkes told investors that a trial run that offered HBO, which owns some of the most prized television content anywhere, with cheaper cable packages was successful. And he seemed to suggest that the company would some day consider selling subscriptions to HBO Go separate from a cable package.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe reality is that cord cutting is happening whether or not these companies do anything or not,\u201d says Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. \u201cMulti-channel TV is in secular decline. It\u2019s not rapid. It\u2019s a slow melting. The question is what do you do to address it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, it\u2019s not just recalcitrant content owners that are holding back the dream of a Web-like TV world. It\u2019s also economics. Buying channels individually may not prove any cheaper for consumers\u2014not after they spend ever-larger sums for broadband service that is sold by the same companies brought them the cable bundle.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWould a $20 a month HBO Go make you leave your cable subscription?\u201d Olgeirson asks. \u201cIf you bought everything \u00e0 la carte, would you save money? It\u2019s not clear.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s challenges like these that have stopped Apple from jumping head first into the battle for the living room. Whether that will change is anyone\u2019s guess. When Rose asked Cook why Apple didn\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d TV, Cook replied: \u201cThis is an area that we continue to look at.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of comment that has kept pundits and fanboys speculating about an Apple television for years.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 07:05:34","updated":"2014-09-15 07:05:34","minute":"7:05 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/is-tv-stuck-in-the-70s\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/is-tv-stuck-in-the-70s\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/apple-ceo-tim-cook-charlie-rose-september-2014.png?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Courtesy: PBS\/Charlie Rose LLC","caption":"Apple CEO Tim Cook speaking to Charlie Rose in September 2014.","attach_id":"787579"},"short_title":"Is TV stuck in the '70s?","excerpt":"Apple CEO Tim Cook thinks so.

No, the important thing to know about Casper is that its packaging is the stuff of social media genius. Somehow, the company has engineered a way to stuff full, queen, and king-sized foam mattresses into small, shippable boxes the size of a mini-fridge. They\u2019re small enough to be delivered by a dutch-bicycle messenger on the streets of New York City. And they\u2019re novel enough to elicit reactions of disbelief and awe on social media.<\/p>\n<p>Actor Ashton Kutcher, who has invested in the startup alongside Steve Nash, Dave Morin, and others, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aplusk\/status\/499319845104517121\">tweeted a photo<\/a> of a Casper box sitting on a doorstep, garnering 174 retweets and 690 favorites.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ashton.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-784837\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ashton.jpg?w=550 038 h=688\" alt=\"ashton\" width=\"550\" height=\"688\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There is no assembly to a Casper bed. You just open the striped box and, with the magical appeal of a grow-in-water toy, poof! It\u2019s a mattress! (And if you\u2019re unhappy with the bed, it\u2019s not going back into that box. The company will have someone pick it up from your house.)<\/p>\n<p>And so Casper unboxing videos are now a popular fixture on the Internet. That phenomenon, along with some insistent branding (the mattresses are referred to as \u201cCaspers\u201d) is how, with no marketing, the company has garnered an impressive parade of <a href=\"https:\/\/caspersleep.com\/press\">positive press<\/a>. In August, the company raised $13.1 million in a Series A funding round from Slow Ventures, Vaizra Investments, Crosslink Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, Cendana Capital, Silas Capital, SV Angel, Lerer Ventures, NEA, Nash\u2019s Configliere Brand Capital, and Kutcher\u2019s A-Grade Investments.<\/p>\n<p>I was told Casper\u2019s offices in New York   s SoHo neighborhood were a \u201clive-work\u201d environment, which I took to mean the company\u2019s employees lived in its showroom. So one day I showed up at 8 a.m. in hopes that workers might be milling about a showroom in pajamas, coding in laptops from beds. I was expecting a cross between <a href=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/7\/79\/Corduroy.jpg\">Corduroy the bear<\/a> and a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/07\/06\/technology\/at-hacker-hostels-living-on-the-cheap-and-dreaming-of-digital-glory.html?pagewanted=all&amp _r=0\">hacker hostel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I was misinformed. The office, cluttered with stacks of Casper boxes, does feature a bedroom, which employees sometimes nap in (though none have stayed overnight). They have their own apartments. They have a separation between their work and personal lives. Casper is apparently not one of <em>those<\/em> startups.<\/p>\n<p>Casper is CEO Philip Krim\u2019s second swipe at the mattress industry. He started selling mattresses in Texas when he was still a college student. He later moved to New York and tried his hand at entrepreneurship, participating in the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator with a marketing startup called VocalizeLocal. When that failed, he decided to merge his two experiences: mattresses and startups.<\/p>\n<p>He reasoned that the mattress manufacturing industry is dominated by a duopoly of massive debt-laden private-equity-backed companies and therefore a good target for a shake-up. (<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/01\/22\/meet-the-warby-parker-of-mattresses\/\">He   s not alone<\/a>.) The retail side of things is controlled by regional fiefdoms. Mattress salespeople work on a commission model, so they\u2019re incentivized to sell the most expensive mattress, and no one really knows anything about mattresses or their various features. There\u2019s memory foam, and gel memory foam, and high density foam, and SmartClimate Systems and Verti-Coil support systems, and Visvo Lumbar Support pads, and Cushion Cloud Construction, and Vertical Zoning. It all sounds very official\u2014and expensive\u2014without conveying any real information.<\/p>\n<p>Krim decided to simplify it. He worked with Jeff Chapin, an industrial designer from the firm IDEO, to create a simple all-foam mattress (despite the manufacturer\u2019s insistence on including the latest gels in the design) with one price point. Krim says it might sell for $3,000 at a traditional mattress store. A queen costs $850 on Casper   s website. \u201cThere\u2019s only one mattress, so there\u2019s no need to compare,\u201d Krim said.<\/p>\n<p>The bed is comfy. I tested it while Krim and Lindsay Kaplan, Casper\u2019s vice president of communications, awkwardly hovered over me. It\u2019s on the soft side, which the company is up-front about. \u201cIf they want a brick, this is probably not for them,\u201d Krim said.<\/p>\n<p>Casper prides itself on \u201cover-the-top\u201d customer service. Half of Casper customers have instant messaged with the CEO, Kaplan says. Sometimes the company sends a random gift to a customer. Since launching on April 22, the company has sold  8220 millions of dollars 8221  worth of mattresses.<\/p>\n<p>Armed with $13.1 million in venture funding, Casper has no intentions of expanding into new mattress lines. But it might take its brand into new product lines, like sheets or pet beds. Over coffee at a nearby restaurant, we riffed on names for pet beds. The cat bed was easy\u2014Catsper, of course. The dog one was tricker. Dogsper? Pupsper? Kaplan was not convinced. \u201cI just want everything in my apartment to be covered in Casper,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 07:29:40","updated":"2014-09-15 07:29:40","minute":"7:29 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/waking-up-with-casper-an-internet-mattress-company\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/waking-up-with-casper-an-internet-mattress-company\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/girl-on-casper-mattress.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Courtesy: Casper","caption":"","attach_id":"787608"},"short_title":"Waking up with Casper, an Internet mattress company","excerpt":"Can an $850 mattress-in-a-box disrupt a duopoly of debt-laden, private-equity-backed companies?

But this much is clear: As our military machine hums into a higher gear, it will produce some winners in the defense industry.<\/p>\n<p>New fights mean new stuff, after all. And following the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014and the belt-tightening at the Pentagon imposed by steep budget cuts\u2014military suppliers are lining up to meet a suddenly restored need for their wares. Presenting his vision for expanding the confrontation with the terrorist group ISIS in a speech to the nation on Wednesday night, President Obama outlined a program of intensified airstrikes designed to keep American troops away from the danger on the ground. So defense analysts are pointing to a pair of sure-bet paydays from the new campaign: for those making and maintaining the aircraft, manned and unmanned, that will swarm the skies over the region, and for those producing the missiles and munitions that will arm them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe drone builders are going to have a field day,\u201d says Dov Zakheim, who served as Pentagon Comptroller during the George W. Bush administration. That could mean a tidy profit for privately held General Atomics, maker of the Predator drone, the granddaddy in the category and still widely in use, as well as the second-generation Reaper, designed to carry 3,000 pounds worth of bombs.

Gunzinger notes that \u201csmall diameter bombs could be a huge winner, since aircraft can carry more of them in a single sortie\u2014and they have very accurate seekers, so they can strike targets with less potential for collateral damage.\u201d Tally up another advantage for Raytheon\u2019s product line, among others.<\/p>\n<p>American military operations targeting ISIS have cost some $600 million since mid-June, with the U.S. now spending more than $7.5 million a day on the conflict by the Pentagon\u2019s own accounting. Zakheim estimates that this figure could conceivably double as the operations intensify and the theater widens to Syria, with a significant chunk of the expenditures going to munitions.<\/p>\n<p>The total price tag for the open-ended conflict, expected to be measured in years rather than months, is anybody\u2019s guess. In the immediate term, however, the White House is pressing Congress to approve $500 million to fund the training and equipping of pro-Western rebel groups in Syria. That alone could mean extra work for a wide array of prime defense contractors, according to Gursky. In the longer run, one defense appropriations lobbyist predicts\u2014a hopeful note in his voice: \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to bust through the budget caps\u201d imposed on the military by the sequester cuts. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight this on the cheap,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>That should mean widely shared benefits for an industry that operates on a \u201cco-opetition\u201d model, in which most big systems include components from several manufacturers\u2014amidst a demand furnished by a rising tide of unrest around the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s paint a picture of the world right now,\u201d Epstein says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Europeans worried about what the Russians are doing in their backyard  we\u2019ve got our hands full right now in Iraq  you\u2019ve got the Israelis with their hands full in their region  and then you have the Chinese and Japanese in the South China Sea.

Why? Workers who care for the elderly and disabled in their homes are \u201can easy target for holding down costs,\u201d she says. \u201cCollectively, as a society, we haven\u2019t valued the work they do in the way we should.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a problem in and of itself, and it has been amplified by the fact that <a href=\"http:\/\/phinational.org\/sites\/phinational.org\/files\/phi-facts-5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the home care industry is the fastest-growing sector of the American economy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Two occupations make up the home care aide profession: personal aides who provide clients with self-care and help them with everyday tasks, and home health aides who assist the disabled, chronically ill, or cognitively impaired and may administer medication or check clients\u2019 vial signs. Put together, about 2 million Americans hold these jobs. (The PHI estimates that there are likely hundreds of thousands of uncounted aides employed by individuals and families.)<\/p>\n<p>The wages these workers earn are painfully low: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/ooh\/healthcare\/personal-care-aides.htm#tab-1\" target=\"_blank\">the median salary for a personal care aide is $19,910 annually<\/a>, or $9.57 an hour  a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/ooh\/healthcare\/home-health-aides.htm#tab-1\" target=\"_blank\">home health aide earns $20,820 or $10.01 per hour<\/a>. As America\u2019s population ages, these professions are expected to grow by 49% and 48%, respectively, from 2012 to 2022, eclipsing the average growth for all occupations: 11%. They are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/emp\/ep_table_103.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the second- and third-fastest growing occupations<\/a> in the nation\u2014behind only industrial-organizational psychologist, a job that brings in median annual wages of $83,750. On the BLS   s list of 30 fastest-growing jobs, personal and home care aides are the worst paid.<\/p>\n<p>It   s no surprise, then, that the home care industry is plagued by high turnover rates, which <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leadingage.org\/uploadedFiles\/Content\/About\/Center_for_Applied_Research\/Publications_and_Products\/Direct%20Care%20Workers%20Report%20%20FINAL%20%282%29.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the Institute for the Future of Aging Services<\/a> pegged at between 40% and 60% for a home health aide who has been on the job for less than a year.<\/p>\n<p>Take all these factors into account and you\u2019ve got the makings of a public health crisis, says Ai-Jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, an advocacy group. \u201cIn light of the Age Wave\u2014the Silver Tsunami\u2014the high rates of burnout, and poverty wages that no one wants to work for\u2014it\u2019s not good for the general public,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>Home care workers, who are employed by third-party agencies or by clients directly, have long been exempt from minimum wage and overtime laws. That will finally come to an end in January, when a Department of Labor regulatory change will grant most home care workers wages of at least $7.25 per hour and overtime.<\/p>\n<p>The ramifications of the new rule illustrate, as Poo puts it, \u201cthe pattern and practice of discrimination\u201d against home care workers. At the time of the rule\u2019s announcement, it promised to give home care workers in 29 states minimum wage and overtime protections for the first time, <a href=\"http:\/\/nelp.3cdn.net\/4c5e433c3fed691479_utm6bpbna.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">according to the National Employment Law Project<\/a>. Many of these states have minimum wage and overtime laws for other workers, of course, but some of them have over the course of their history carved out exemptions for in-home care providers. That means that in some states home care workers will earn the federally mandated $7.25 an hour for the first time in January, but if their state has a higher minimum wage that excludes in-home workers, they won\u2019t be eligible for the higher rate. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nelp.org\/page\/content\/state_table#Alaska\">Alaska, for instance<\/a>, enforces a minimum wage of $7.75 but it also has an exemption for \u201cdomestic service\u201d employees, so most home care workers in that state will be subject to the federal $7.25 rate come January, not the state\u2019s higher wage.<\/p>\n<p>At the federal level, home health care workers aren\u2019t covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which only covers \u201cfacility\u201d workers, according to PHI. And anti-discrimination laws, such as the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, generally only cover employers with multiple employees, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.epi.org\/files\/2013\/bp369-in-home-workers-shierholz.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">says the Economics Policy Institute,<\/a> meaning some in-house workers are excluded.<\/p>\n<p>Home health workers employed by individual households aren\u2019t eligible for workers\u2019 compensation, family and medical leave, and can\u2019t enroll in a 401(k), PHI says.<\/p>\n<p>In the hierarchy of workers, home health care workers are at the bottom, below even low-paid fast-food workers, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/fast-food-workers-strike-wages\/\" target=\"_blank\">whose recent strikes and protests<\/a> have drummed up public empathy. This is by no means a new development.<\/p>\n<p>During the negotiations of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which instituted minimum wage and overtime laws as part of the New Deal, members of Congress from southern states refused to sign onto the bill if domestic and farm workers\u2014industries made up largely of African Americans at the time\u2014were included, according to Peggie Smith, a labor and employment law professor at Washington University School of Law. So these workers were left out of the legislation as it became law.<\/p>\n<p>During the Progressive Era, Smith says, this work was regarded as having little value since it was considered an ideal training ground for women who would soon be married. And the work itself was seen as easy and stress-free. By 1940, Smith says, 26 states had minimum wage laws, but only Wisconsin\u2019s applied to women doing domestic work, including home care. Likewise, by 1941, 43 states enforced maximum-hour laws that protected women, but only one of them covered women engaged in domestic work, Smith says.<\/p>\n<p>The demographics of the home care industry continue to put it at the short end of the pay and benefits stick. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s not a group with a lot of power,\u201d says Marquand. <a href=\"http:\/\/phinational.org\/sites\/phinational.org\/files\/phi-facts-5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">According to PHI<\/a>, 91% of home care aides are female, 56% are non-white minorities, 24% of them are foreign-born, and 58% have a high school education or less.<\/p>\n<p>Seventy-three percent of the $61 billion home health care services industry is paid for with public funds, primarily through Medicaid. A common argument against raising home care workers\u2019 wages is that an increase would leave states without the funds to provide in-home care for all of the elderly and disabled individuals who need it. <a href=\"http:\/\/medicaiddirectors.org\/sites\/medicaiddirectors.org\/files\/public\/namd_ltr_to_dol_flsa_rule_140423.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The National Association of Medicaid directors, for instance, cited such concerns<\/a> when it sought to delay the regulatory change giving home care workers minimum wage rights in April. Smith points out that the same argument could be made about the pay of other publicly funded employees, like police officers, fire fighters, and hospital workers.<\/p>\n<p>Labor efforts provided these workers with a brief glimmer of hope. Since 2010, workers in New York, California, Hawaii, and Massachusetts won the passage of domestic workers\u2019 bills of rights that typically provide for days of rest, overtime, and protection against discrimination. Another notable victory came in Washington state earlier this month <a href=\"http:\/\/seiu775.org\/clc2014\/\" target=\"_blank\">when the home care workers there, represented by the Service Employees International Union<\/a>, negotiated a contract with the state that will give them average hourly pay of more than $14 per hour.<\/p>\n<p>But a recent Supreme Court ruling has thrown a wrench into those efforts. In <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/06\/30\/supreme-court-public-unions\/\" target=\"_blank\">a 5-4 ruling in June<\/a>, the justices recognized a category of \u201cpartial public employees\u201d that cannot be forced to contribute union fees. The decision put the brakes on the unions\u2019 efforts to recruit home care aides, a ballooning pool of potential members.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow does one move forward with organizing in spite of this case? 8221  Smith says.  8220 People are still trying to figure that out.\u201d Something has to give, and fast.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor seniors and people with disabilities, it\u2019s already hard to find a good direct care worker,\u201d says Joe Caldwell, director of long-term services and support policy for the National Council on Aging. \u201cThe number of people needing care is going to double in decade, and fewer workers are going to be willing to work for nothing.\u201d<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 05:00:51","updated":"2014-09-15 05:00:51","minute":"5:00 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/home-care-workers\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/home-care-workers\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/452088476.jpg?w=800&h=488&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_must_reads_2x","credit":"Bonnie Jo Mount\u2014The Washington Post\u2014Getty Images","caption":"A home health aide helps a patient in Washington, DC.","attach_id":786066},"short_title":"The worst paying fastest-growing job in America","excerpt":"<p>Historical discrimination, demographics, and public funding have left home care workers at the very bottom of the American work hierarchy.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"381338","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/claire-zillman\/","name":"Claire Zillman","twitter":"clairezillman","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"55\" height=\"55\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/claire-zillman-759.jpg?w=55\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"FORTUNE MAGAZINE DITORS HEADSHOTS - PHOTO EDITOR NEIL HARRIS\" \/>","bio":"","title":"","company":""}],"sections":[{"term_id":20466,"name":"Careers","slug":"careers","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46729,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News you can utilize to develop and advance your career and how to position yourself to get that great new job.

During that time, the former dean of New York University\u2019s undergraduate business program has led dramatic change at the school on nearly every front.<\/p>\n<p>The latest piece\u2014announced Monday\u2014is a new strategy focused on \u201cinspiring growth.\u201d Close observers may wonder why the school is tinkering once again with the Kellogg brand. After all, it was only three years ago that the school launched an ambitious effort to rebrand itself under the tagline: \u201cThink Bravely: We believe that business can be bravely led, passionately collaborative, and world changing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But Blount, a cerebral academic with a reputation for being a whirlwind, insists the new campaign is a smart refinement of all the work that has gone on to refresh and update the school over the past 30 months or so.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt makes more concrete how we deliver on our promise,\u201d says Blount, the first outsider to lead Kellogg in three decades. \u201cWe launched    Think Bravely    as a placeholder for a deeper brand strategy. It tapped into the culture and spirit of Kellogg, but it didn\u2019t prescribe a path. Growth is the most pressing challenge every organization faces.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The upshot: After a year-long effort that gathered input from thousands of \u201cstakeholders, including faculty, current and prospective students, alumni, employers, and administrators, Kellogg is now the school where brave leaders inspire growth in people, organizations and markets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The campaign is the handiwork of Tim Simonds, who had been recruited to Kellogg by Blount as the school\u2019s chief marketing and engagement officer. A Kellogg alum, Simonds had been vice president and general manager of GE   s Healthcare IT unit. Prior to joining GE, he worked at United Airlines as managing director of marketing and merchandising, and began his career with a 13-year tenure at Procter &amp  Gamble, where he was brand manager for the Olay and Cascade brands.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we are really focused on is what brave leaders do: they inspire growth,\u201d says Simonds.  8220 From a student perspective the whole idea of personal growth is extremely important. And our corporate partners  8230  believe the path forward is all around growth. The research shows that 75% of total shareholder return for top S&amp P companies is driven by growth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The new brand strategy\u2014evident in everything from the school\u2019s new logo and tagline to its new advertising, website, and publications\u2014is likely to get the most attention, but the more meaningful news at Kellogg is what has gone on under the hood in the past four years. At a time when graduate business education has become an increasingly commoditized product, Kellogg has aggressively moved to change or significantly update nearly everything it has been doing.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to find a dean who has a truly distinctive vision for a business school. Everyone wants to be more global, to infuse ethics and integrity into the curriculum, to teach students to be more entrepreneurial and innovative, and to put more intellectual rigor into MBA programs that at many schools have become little more than a two-year search for a better job.<\/p>\n<p>At the heart of Blount\u2019s strategy is an effort to redefine the model of a business school from one based on the narrow business disciplines of accounting, finance, marketing, organizational behavior, and operations, to one centered on key business objectives, with the overriding goal being growth.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, Kellogg stood out from other business schools through its strength in marketing and its student culture of collaboration. Blount is not abandoning those attributes. But she is trying to broaden the public\u2019s perception of the school by changing its underlying approach to the market. \u201cWe have always been a general management school,\u201d explains Blount. \u201cThere were people in the market who tried to portray us as just a this-or-that school. That was a defensive tactic by competitors. Yes, we had stronger marketing relative to our peers, but it was a market-created perspective to categorize Kellogg as a marketing school and not make us as fierce a competitor. We have to push back on that by showing that we have never been just that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kellogg   s changes have come about from \u201cwalking the halls, having the meetings, talking to all the stakeholders,\u201d says Blount. \u201cWe have had nearly 40 faculty task forces over the past four years. The faculty has set the direction. The change has been paced, and it\u2019s from within.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With buy-in from faculty, Blount has streamlined 25 research centers into either one of six core departments or into four cross-disciplinary initiatives: markets and customer  architectures of collaboration  innovation and entrepreneurship  and public-private interface.<\/p>\n<p>In the last two-and-a-half years, the school has launched 55 new courses that now account for 25% of Kellogg\u2019s total offerings. There are six new courses on growth and scaling, a dozen new courses on innovation and entrepreneurship, and three new courses in data analytics that now fold into an 11-course sequence on the subject.\u201cThat kind of innovation is pretty unparalleled in academia,\u201d says Blount. \u201cIt was a huge structural and political undertaking, but we have seen great progress from it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Every month, the dean says, 10 to 15 Kellogg faculty members are being taken out to meet with the senior leadership of major corporations to connect their research with the real world and its challenges. These \u201cfaculty immersion\u201d trips have put Kellogg professors on treks all over the world. Some 30 members of the faculty have been to at least one of the BRIC countries for multiple tours in Brazil, Russia, India, and China. This year, the school may add Indonesia to the list.<\/p>\n<p>Kellogg\u2019s dive into data analytics partly stems from a Silicon Valley trip to Facebook headquarters last fall. Florian Zettelmeyer, who leads the school\u2019s program on data analytics, sat with high-placed Kellogg alumni in the valley. \u201cWe said, \u2018Here is our current curriculum. What holes do we have and where should we plug them?\u2019\u201d recalls Simonds, who was in attendance. Out of the exercise came the idea to create a course called \u201cVisualization for Persuasion.\u201d All told, Zettelmeyer has led the data analytics faculty on five immersion trips in the past year, including to IBM\u2019s data center, Nielsen Neuroscience, Cleversafe, and Civis Analytics. The professor also delivered the keynote address at General Electric\u2019s Mind &amp  Machines event last October, speaking immediately after CEO Jeff Immelt.<\/p>\n<p>Dialogues with corporations have led to a group of new courses on growth and scaling, including \u201cStrategies for Growth,\u201d \u201cScaling Operations: Linking Strategy &amp  Execution,\u201d \u201cScaling Operations Lab,\u201d Managing Organizations for Growth,\u201d and \u201cHuman Capital and Enterprise Scaling.\u201d Given the school\u2019s historic prominence in marketing, Kellogg also has such new courses as \u201cMarketing Driven Growth\u201d and \u201cMarketing Project Laboratory Course\u2014Generating Profitable Growth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The new courses have been introduced as Blount works to change the school\u2019s degree offerings. Recognizing that a growing number of professionals are interested in getting their MBA in a single year, Kellogg has put more resources into its accelerated program. This summer, the school enrolled 120 students, a 50% increase from the 80 MBA candidates that enrolled in the fast-track program when Blount arrived at Kellogg in 2010. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to slightly shrink the two-year program in a way that makes sense,\u201d says Blount. \u201cIt is about rebalancing the portfolio to meet the demands of the market.<\/p>\n<p>She also introduced an M.S. in management studies for liberal arts undergraduates who want to learn about management and business. The program, which enrolls students in mid-July and graduates them the following year in mid-May, will expand next year. For two pilot cohorts, the program was limited to Northwestern students. Blount says Kellogg will introduce the program to students outside the university next year. Though limited to just 30 students now, the dean says that the size of the program is dependent on the quality of applicants it receives. But Kellogg will move the program to downtown Chicago, where it could accommodate as many as 200 students, because \u201cwe think the energy down there is great and we can bring in executives every day, so that will enrich that program.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the school also launched a fifth international Executive MBA program with a foreign partner, the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University. More importantly, however, Blount has moved these EMBA partnerships from loose affiliations to an integrated network where schools can work closely with each other. Students in each EMBA program now take two to four courses at other network schools. \u201cWhen I got to Kellogg, those partnerships were entirely separate programs,\u201d says Blount. \u201cThe deans of those programs had never met. We created an infrastructure where the network has its own team based at Kellogg and the deans meet annually to set an agenda for each year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The school expects to continue to build on that network, with 37 exchange programs across 20 countries and a new course for full-time MBA students to be launched this spring called \u201cInternational Growth Lab.\u201d \u201cMost business schools programs take a cohort of students, ship them to a foreign country where they work on a problem, and then bring them back home,\u201d says Simonds. \u201cThis program will use the EMBA network so that our students will work together with the full-time students of our partner schools. We\u2019ll have about 20 Kellogg students in the pilot 8230 .\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Already, says Blount, 125 to 150 of Kellogg\u2019s MBA candidates are doing a quarter abroad at a partner or exchange school, while another 200 do a two-week experiential learning course abroad. \u201cAbout 50% of all our MBA students are choosing to participate in these options,\u201d says Blount.<\/p>\n<p>All of this change takes money, of course. Blount, who broke ground on a new business school building last fall, says the school has just completed a record-breaking year in fundraising. During the 2013-2014 academic year, Kellogg raised $47 million, bringing the $350 million goal of a capital campaign to $215 million.<\/p>\n<p>More money. A new building. A reconfigured brand. An entirely new senior leadership team. A radical reorganization of the faculty. New and refreshed courses. New degree offerings and a new emphasis on the growth of the one-year MBA. An expansion of the global EMBA program.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s enough change in four years to make one dizzy. Or, to borrow Kellogg\u2019s new tagline, it\u2019s the work of a leader who has inspired a great deal of growth.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/poetsandquants.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>More from Poets&amp Quants:<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/poetsandquants.com\/2014\/09\/14\/the-best-consulting-firms-to-work-for\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Best Consulting Firms To Work For<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/poetsandquants.com\/2014\/09\/04\/the-class-of-2016-by-the-numbers\/\" target=\"_blank\">The MBA Class of 2016 By The Numbers<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/poetsandquants.com\/2014\/09\/05\/what-ever-happened-to-the-mbas-on-the-apprentice\/\" target=\"_blank\">Whatever Happened To The MBAs on The Apprentice<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 05:00:55","updated":"2014-09-15 05:00:55","minute":"5:00 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/northwestern-kellogg-sally-blount\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/northwestern-kellogg-sally-blount\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/12\/130730111412-northwestern-kellogg-2.jpg?w=800&h=488&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_must_reads_2x","credit":"Photo: Mike Willis\/Flickr","caption":"","attach_id":277123},"short_title":"Inside Northwestern Kellogg B-school's ambitious growth plan","excerpt":"<p>More money, a new building, a reconfigured brand, an entirely new senior leadership team, and a radical reorganization of the faculty, all in four years.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"282031","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/john-a-byrne\/","name":"John A.

The company that in the early 1970s  8220 began as a quasi-communal hippie farm, 8221  Pollan wrote, had, in the words of its erstwhile-hippie founder Gene Kahn, morphed into a  8220 PR farm 8221  for General Mills after that company acquired it in 2000. Kahn joined General Mills as a vice president, and he enthusiastically signed on to that company   s far-more-corporate approach to organic food.<\/p>\n<p>Ever since, critics of the food industry have cited Cascadian Farm as an outfit that adheres to the letter of the law without necessarily adhering to the spirit of the organic-food movement. Similar complaints are already being issued in regard to General Mills    <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/08\/general-mills-expaning-organics-natural-foods-annies\/\">announcement<\/a> on Monday that it will acquire Annie   s Inc. <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"BNNY\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/bnny\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">BNNY<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, a Berkeley, Calif., company that <em>The New York Times<\/em> <a href=\"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2014\/09\/08\/general-mills-to-buy-annies-for-820-million-in-cash\/\">noted<\/a> is known for its  8220 earthy vibe. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>The question for critics is whether General Mills cares more about Annie   s vibe than it does about its fealty to organic principles. In an email to <em>Fortune<\/em>, Pollan said he   s not familiar with the details of the Annie   s acquisition, but added that  8220 the parallels with Cascadian Farm would seem to be relevant. Is General Mills committed to the ideals of Annie   s, or just the brand? 8221 <\/p>\n<p>For investors, it probably doesn   t matter. General Mills    cash offer of $820 million (or $46 a share) is a 37% premium over Monday   s closing price. That   s still considerably lower than the $51.36 Annie   s shares reached in October.<\/p>\n<p>The acquisition is meant to help General Mills make up for <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/06\/25\/general-mills-earnings-down\/\">flagging cereal sales<\/a>. The company notes that the  8220 organic and natural 8221  category is growing at about a 12% annual clip industrywide. General Mills    Small Planet Foods division, which markets Cascadian Farm, Muir Glen, and other labels, reported revenue of about $330 million last year. Annie   s annual sales are at about $200 million a year.<\/p>\n<p>The near-absence of organic crunchiness was noticeable in General Mills    announcement of the acquisition. The closest it got was in a statement from Jeff Harmening, General Mills    executive vice president and chief operating officer, who alluded to Annie   s  8220 purpose-driven culture and authentic brand. 8221  Otherwise, he was all business:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Annie   s competes in a number of attractive food categories, with particular strength in convenient meals and snacks\u2014two of General Mills    priority platforms. \u2026 We believe that combining the Annie   s product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities with General Mills    supply chain, sales and marketing resources will accelerate the growth of our organic and natural foods business.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, Annie   s CEO John Foraker <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/annieshomegrown\/posts\/10152358423211334\">took to Facebook<\/a> to try to reassure customers with a statement that was impassioned, but vague:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I want you all to know that our mission, culture, and values and the things we stand for will remain the same. We   ll continue to make the same great products, more of them actually, using ingredients we are proud of, business practices that are respectful of the environment, and that make our planet a better place. We   ve spent 25 years building trust with consumers, one interaction at a time. We will continue to do that. Count on it. I always ask people to listen to what we say, but more importantly, watch what we do! We will not let you down! Our mission: We cultivate a healthier, happier world by spreading goodness through nourishing foods, honest words and conduct that is considerate and forever kind to the planet. that mission is hard won and has been built with integrity. We will never abandon it, but rather we will further it, by putting our product into millions of new homes, which will expand our positive impact even more. I have given 15 years of my life to that mission and I am not stopping now.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A commenter on Foraker   s post noted General Mills    opposition to a defeated California ballot measure, Prop. 37, in 2012 that would have required food products containing genetically modified ingredients to be so labeled. General Mills donated more than $1 million to defeat the measure.  8220 I will not give money to a company that is against what Annie   s stood for, 8221  she wrote. Her comment received 737 likes, and other erstwhile Annie   s fans piled on with similar comments.<\/p>\n<p>The passionate objections to the merger reveal how successful Annie   s has been in maintaining its reputation of being  8220 homespun and healthful, 8221  as <em>The New York Times<\/em> put it, despite facts that would tend to counter that image.<\/p>\n<p>Launched in 1989 by Annie Withey, who initially sold the company   s flagship macaroni-and-cheese brand in grocery stores in the northeast, Annie   s was acquired by the private equity firm Solera Capital in 2002. It went public in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Although much of the coverage of the General Mills acquisition has identified Annie   s as an  8220 organic 8221  producer, that   s only partly true. Many of its products are not certified organic. In 2007, all of Annie   s products bore an  8220 organic 8221  label. Now, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pressherald.com\/2011\/11\/16\/for-cereal-natural-may-not-be-as-natural-as-you-think_2011-11-16\/\">only about one-fifth of them do<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Annie   s, then, isn   t any crunchier than General Mills    existing organic lines, but since Annie   s still has that  8220 vibe, 8221  the question is whether it will help General Mills in the long run. The food giant  8220 risks smothering its latest acquisition target, 8221  <a href=\"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2014\/09\/09\/the-risk-in-the-general-mills-deal-for-annies\/\">concluded<\/a> Kevin Allison of Reuters    Breakingviews. While the companies have made assurances that Annie   s will be left to operate independently  8212  maintaining its Berkeley headquarters and retaining Foraker to run the business  8212  while still being able to tap into General Mills    marketing and distribution infrastructure, General Mills  8220 may be left relying on elusive revenue synergies to make the acquisition play, 8221  Allison wrote.<\/p>\n<p>If that happens, it will save costs, but it could dilute the brand.<\/p>\n<p>That   s the risk for any big food company that tries to have it both ways. The  8220 organic and natural 8221  category is burgeoning, while many mainstream categories  8212  like breakfast cereals  8212  have slowed or stopped growing altogether. But for many consumers, a big part of the appeal (perceived or real) of organic and natural brands is the independence (perceived or real) of the producer. Big food companies that acquire such producers must walk a fine line to maintain that image while extracting the maximum value from it.<\/p>\n<p>They have had mixed success, and the successes have often resulted from allowing acquired companies to go it alone to the extent possible. For instance, while a lot of people know that Ben &amp  Jerry   s is owned by the giant Unilever <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"UN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/un\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">UN<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, the brand is still largely thought of as independent, because in many ways, it is. Ben &amp  Jerry   s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/articles\/2014-07-31\/gmo-labeling-ben-and-jerrys-parent-company-unilever-at-odds\">takes the opposite side<\/a> from Unilever on a host of issues, including GMOs.<\/p>\n<p>Its marketing is separate and distinct from that of other Unilever brands. Some  8220 synergies 8221  might be lost, but the long run success of Ben &amp  Jerry   s, which Unilever acquired in 2000, has depended on the brand   s distinctive image.<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, in 2000 (which turns out to have been a big year for such deals) Kellogg <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"K\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/k\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">K<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> acquired Kashi, the once-beloved company best known for its natural cereals, and, over time, managed the brand to disaster.<\/p>\n<p>In 2012 it was <a href=\"http:\/\/usatoday30.usatoday.com\/money\/industries\/food\/story\/2012-04-29\/kashi-natural-claims\/54616576\/1\">discovered<\/a> that Kashi cereals contained GMOs. This went viral on social media. The company only made matters worse by noting the plain fact that the federal government does not regulate the word  8220 natural 8221  on food labels. That same year, another uproar ensued due to Kellogg   s donations to the  8220 No on Prop. 37 8243  campaign. In 2013, Kellogg moved Kashi from its longtime home in La Jolla, Calif., to Kellogg headquarter in Battle Creek, Mich.  8212  but it has already decided to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bakingbusiness.com\/articles\/news_home\/Financial-Performance\/2014\/08\/Kellogg_installs_new_leadershi.aspx?ID=%7BC6ABCEA3-7930-49BD-ADCE-47E1C7559A %7D&amp e=casey@littlerooster.net&amp cck=1\">reverse<\/a> that move in its effort to restore the brand   s image.<\/p>\n<p>General Mills has certainly done well with its organic and natural lines, which it runs in a separate division called Small Planet Foods. Its Nature Valley granola bars might the opposite of healthy (12 grams of sugar per serving), and even the <a href=\"http:\/\/brucebradley.com\/food\/nature-valley-or-a-slippery-slope\/\">opposite<\/a> of  8220 natural, 8221  but their  8220 wholesome 8221  image is what sells them (and the sweetness is what keeps people coming back for more, whether or not they happen to look at the nutrition information.)

The most salient example these days is the rash of thefts of credit card data from big-name retail chains like Home Depot and Target.<\/p>\n<p>While these threats are headline-grabbing and particularly frightening because e-commerce is a relatively new phenomenon and businesses and consumers aren   t totally sure how to protect themselves from hackers, it   s still a drop in the bucket in terms of overall organized crime earnings.<\/p>\n<p>A 2013 survey from Javelin Strategy and Research <a href=\"https:\/\/www.javelinstrategy.com\/uploads\/web_brochure\/1303.R_2013IdentityFraudBrochure.pdf\">estimates<\/a> that the annual total loss to Americans due to identity theft was roughly $20 billion. But much of those costs comes from efforts to prevent identity theft or recover from its effects, rather than what thieves earn from their crimes. Compare that to estimates of pure revenue from other forms of organized crime like the drug trade and human trafficking: the Organization of American States estimates that the revenue for cocaine sales in the U.S. has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cicad.oas.org\/drogas\/elinforme\/informeDrogas2013\/laEconomicaNarcotrafico_ENG.pdf\">reached $34 billion annually<\/a>. When you add the market for other illicit drugs and revenue generators like human trafficking and extortion, it becomes clear that organized crime is still making most of its money from its legacy businesses, despite the fact that criminals are always looking for new ways to make a buck.<\/p>\n<p>So, who are the biggest organized crime gangs around the world and how do they make their money? Organized crime revenues are very difficult to estimate, as criminals often spend a significant amount of time trying to hide what they make. Also,  8220 organized crime 8221  is a loosely defined concept. Anything from a vast drug smuggling ring to a handful of car thieves can be classified as organized crime groups, and the cohesiveness of organized crime organizations around the world varies widely. Some groups, like Japan   s Yakuza, are highly organized and hierarchical, allowing economists and crime fighters in Japan to attribute much higher revenue totals to Yakuza groups than others around the world. Here are the top five criminal gangs, ranked by revenue estimates:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Yamaguchi Gumi\u2014Revenue: $80 billion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The largest known gang in the world is called the Yamaguchi Gumi, one of several groups collectively referred to in Japan as  8220 Yakuza, 8221  a term that is roughly equivalent to the American use of  8220 mafia. 8221  The Yamaguchi Gumi make more money from drug trafficking than any other source, <a href=\"http:\/\/flarenetwork.org\/report\/enquiries\/article\/shinogi_the_businesses_of_the_japanese_mafia.htm\">according<\/a> to Hiromitsu Suganuma, Japan   s former national police chief. The next two leading sources of revenue are gambling and extortion, followed closely by  8220 dispute resolution. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>The Yakuza date back hundreds of years, and according to Dennis McCarthy, author of <em>An Economic History of Organized Crime<\/em>, Yakuza groups are among the most centralized in the world. While other East Asian gangs like Chinese Triads, which are a loose conglomeration of criminals bonded together mostly by familial relations, Yakuza are bound together by  8220 elaborate hierarchies, 8221  and members, once initiated, must subvert all other allegiances in favor of the Yakuza. Even with the Japanese government cracking down on Yakuza in recent years, this centralized structure has made it easy to attribute a massive amount of revenue to this single gang.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Solntsevskaya Bratva\u2014Revenue: $8.5 billion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Russian mafia groups sit on the other side of the organizational spectrum from Yakuza. Their structure, according to Frederico Varese, a professor of criminology at the University of Oxford and an expert on international organized crime, is highly decentralized. The group is composed of 10 separate quasi-autonomous  8220 brigades 8221  that operate more or less independently of each other. The group does pool its resources, however, and the money is overseen by a 12-person council that  8220 meets regularly in different parts of the world, often disguising their meetings as festive occasions, 8221  Varesi says.<\/p>\n<p>It   s estimated that the group claims upwards of 9,000 members, and that it   s bread and butter is the drug trade and human trafficking. Russian organized crime in general is heavily involved in the heroin trade that originates in Afghanistan: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unodc.org\/documents\/wdr\/WDR_2010\/1.2_The_global_heroin_market.pdf\">it   s estimated<\/a> that Russia consumes about 12% of the world   s heroin, while it contains just 0.5% of the world   s population.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Camorra\u2014Revenue: $4.9 billion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While the Italian-American mafia has been severely weakened in recent decades by law enforcement, the Italian mafia in the old country is still running strong. Despite years of efforts from citizens, journalists, and government officials, the local governments in Italy remain linked to and protective of various mafia groups, to the point where a 2013 study from the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica and the Joint research Centre on Transnational Crime estimated that mafia activities generate revenue of $33 billion dollars, mostly divided among Italy   s four major mafia gangs.<\/p>\n<p>Camorra is the most successful of these groups, raking in an estimated $4.9 billion per year on everything from  8220 sexual exploitation, firearms trafficking, drugs, counterfeiting, gambling  8230  usury and extortion, 8221  according to the report. And Camorra has been at it a long time. Based in Naples, the group   s history dates back to the 19th century, when it was formed initially as a prison gang. As members were released, the group flourished during the bloody political struggles in Italy during the 1800s by offering protection services and as a force for political organization among Italy   s poor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.    Ndrangheta\u2014R<\/strong><strong>evenue: $4.5 billion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Based in the Calabria region of Italy, the    Ndarangheta is the country   s second largest mafia group by revenue. While it is involved in many of the same illicit activities as Camorra,    Ndrangheta has made its name for itself by building international ties with South American cocaine dealers, and it controls much of the transatlantic drug market that feeds Europe. It has also been expanding its operations in the U.S. and has helped prop up the Gambino and Bonnano crime families in New York. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/raids-in-us-italy-target-new-mafia-drug-trafficking-route-linking-new-yorks-gambino-family-to-ndrangheta-crime-syndicate\/\">In February<\/a>, Italian and American police forces arrested dozens of    Ndrangheta and Gambino family members and charged them with crimes related to the transatlantic drug trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Sinaloa Cartel\u2014Revenue $3 billion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sianola is Mexico   s largest drug cartel, one of several gangs that has been terrorizing the Mexican population as it serves as the middleman between South American producers of illegal drugs and an unquenchable American market. The White House Office of Drug Control Policy estimates that Americans spend $100 billion on illegal drugs each year, and the RAND Corporation <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/06\/17\/magazine\/how-a-mexican-drug-cartel-makes-its-billions.html?pagewanted=all\">says<\/a> that about $6.5 billion of that reaches Mexican cartels. With an estimated 60% market share, Sinola cartel is raking in approximately $3 billion per year.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the fact that Sinaloa   s leader was <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/9283\/what-the-arrest-of-el-chapo-means-for-mexico\/\">arrested<\/a> February, the cartel <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/06\/17\/magazine\/how-a-mexican-drug-cartel-makes-its-billions.html?pagewanted=all\">seems<\/a> to have avoided the sort of bloody\u2014and costly\u2014succession battle that has plagued some groups when a leader is taken out of commission.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp <\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 14, 2014","published":"2014-09-14

Silicon Valley sees Alibaba","content":"<p>Wall Street is seeing green this week regarding the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba. It <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/12\/alibaba-is-on-track-to-become-the-biggest-u-s-ipo-ever-here-are-three-charts-you-need-to-see\/\">hopes to raise<\/a> more than $20 billion.<\/p>\n<p>How Silicon Valley views Alibaba is another matter altogether. While respectful of Alibaba   s success in China and all that capital it shortly will have in its coffers, the U.S. tech scene views Alibaba as nearly a non-entity, now and for the foreseeable future, for potential competition in its core markets. At the same time, it sees Alibaba as already an active sparring partner for investments and, perhaps, acquisitions of tech startups.<\/p>\n<p>Like its major competitors Tencent and Baidu, Alibaba made its name\u2014and its profits\u2014in China. Non-Chinese revenues are about 10% of its total today, however, particularly coming from AliExpress, its global e-commerce business. According to Alibaba   s IPO prospectus, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1577552\/000119312514333674\/d709111df1a.htm\">which you can read yourself<\/a> if you have a few spare hours, Russia, Brazil and the U.S. are the highest-growth regions for AliExpress. (The other day <em>The Wall Street Journal<\/em> nicely covered Alibaba   s <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/articles\/chinas-alibaba-draws-brazilian-bargain-shoppers-1410555882\">foray into Brazil<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Operating in the U.S. will be a different story. Silicon Valley executives absolutely are taking Alibaba seriously. But they tend to note that Alibaba and its peers thrived in a country that put its thumb on the scales in favor of Chinese Internet companies while keeping U.S. competitors at a distance. Google, Facebook, and eBay all have had their problems in China, while the Chinese giants haven   t yet really tried their hands meaningfully in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to investments, however, Alibaba has been making its presence felt. It hired Michael Zeisser, a seasoned dealmaking executive from John Malone   s Liberty Media, to run its U.S.-based corporate development. (It   s hard to imagine a Chinese biz-dev executive <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zeisser.com\/\">putting his email <\/a>on the web to solicit investments.) It also has hired seasoned public-relations as well as investor-relations talent in Jim Wilkinson, a former press aide for Henry Paulson at the U.S. Treasury, and Jane Penner, a Google veteran. These U.S.-based hires undoubtedly were mostly about ensuring a smooth IPO, but they also will be available for any future push on U.S. soil.<\/p>\n<p>The investments themselves are varied and high dollar value, and each can be viewed as targeting a potential non-Chinese competitor. Alibaba plunked down more than $200 million for a  % stake in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shoprunner.com\/about\/\">Shoprunner<\/a>, the Amazon Prime competitor headed by ex-Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson. More recently it joined several U.S. venture capital firms in investing in Lyft, which presumably buttresses its China-based taxi strategy that <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/08\/ubers-challenge-in-china\/\">Miguel Helft wrote about last week<\/a> on Fortune.com. (Taxis essentially are a payments play to Alibaba, putting it in potential conflict with the likes of eBay and now Apple.) Alibaba took a $120-million stake in San Francisco game developer Kabam, which already had a studio in China.<\/p>\n<p>For its IPO, Alibaba is coming to the U.S., its current best opportunity to raise capital. Watching how it spend that money in the U.S. will an interesting next chapter.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"8\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3780601627001-8\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3780601627001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1D90KGJ\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp gdfp_req=1&amp impl=s&amp output=xml_vast2&amp iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/finance_bc&amp sz=1000x1&amp cust_params=tags%3Dalibaba%2Calibabagroup%2Cipo%2Cmarkettrends%2Cstephengandel%26ch%3Dfinance%26topic%3Dmarkettrends&amp unviewed_position_start=1&amp correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences() \n\t\t\t<\/script>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 01:50:10","updated":"2014-09-15 01:50:10","minute":"1:50 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/alibaba-silicon-valley-ipo\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/alibaba-silicon-valley-ipo\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/alibaba-jack-ma-bloomberg.jpg?w=80&h=80&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_popular_articles","credit":"Bloomberg\u2014Getty Images","caption":"Alibaba Group CEO Jack Ma.","attach_id":"788169"},"short_title":"How Silicon Valley sees Alibaba","excerpt":"<p>A competitor?

During that time, the former dean of New York University\u2019s undergraduate business program has led dramatic change at the school on nearly every front.<\/p>\n<p>The latest piece\u2014announced Monday\u2014is a new strategy focused on \u201cinspiring growth.\u201d Close observers may wonder why the school is tinkering once again with the Kellogg brand. After all, it was only three years ago that the school launched an ambitious effort to rebrand itself under the tagline: \u201cThink Bravely: We believe that business can be bravely led, passionately collaborative, and world changing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But Blount, a cerebral academic with a reputation for being a whirlwind, insists the new campaign is a smart refinement of all the work that has gone on to refresh and update the school over the past 30 months or so.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt makes more concrete how we deliver on our promise,\u201d says Blount, the first outsider to lead Kellogg in three decades. \u201cWe launched    Think Bravely    as a placeholder for a deeper brand strategy. It tapped into the culture and spirit of Kellogg, but it didn\u2019t prescribe a path. Growth is the most pressing challenge every organization faces.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The upshot: After a year-long effort that gathered input from thousands of \u201cstakeholders, including faculty, current and prospective students, alumni, employers, and administrators, Kellogg is now the school where brave leaders inspire growth in people, organizations and markets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The campaign is the handiwork of Tim Simonds, who had been recruited to Kellogg by Blount as the school\u2019s chief marketing and engagement officer. A Kellogg alum, Simonds had been vice president and general manager of GE   s Healthcare IT unit. Prior to joining GE, he worked at United Airlines as managing director of marketing and merchandising, and began his career with a 13-year tenure at Procter &amp  Gamble, where he was brand manager for the Olay and Cascade brands.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we are really focused on is what brave leaders do: they inspire growth,\u201d says Simonds.  8220 From a student perspective the whole idea of personal growth is extremely important. And our corporate partners  8230  believe the path forward is all around growth. The research shows that 75% of total shareholder return for top S&amp P companies is driven by growth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The new brand strategy\u2014evident in everything from the school\u2019s new logo and tagline to its new advertising, website, and publications\u2014is likely to get the most attention, but the more meaningful news at Kellogg is what has gone on under the hood in the past four years. At a time when graduate business education has become an increasingly commoditized product, Kellogg has aggressively moved to change or significantly update nearly everything it has been doing.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to find a dean who has a truly distinctive vision for a business school. Everyone wants to be more global, to infuse ethics and integrity into the curriculum, to teach students to be more entrepreneurial and innovative, and to put more intellectual rigor into MBA programs that at many schools have become little more than a two-year search for a better job.<\/p>\n<p>At the heart of Blount\u2019s strategy is an effort to redefine the model of a business school from one based on the narrow business disciplines of accounting, finance, marketing, organizational behavior, and operations, to one centered on key business objectives, with the overriding goal being growth.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, Kellogg stood out from other business schools through its strength in marketing and its student culture of collaboration. Blount is not abandoning those attributes. But she is trying to broaden the public\u2019s perception of the school by changing its underlying approach to the market. \u201cWe have always been a general management school,\u201d explains Blount. \u201cThere were people in the market who tried to portray us as just a this-or-that school. That was a defensive tactic by competitors. Yes, we had stronger marketing relative to our peers, but it was a market-created perspective to categorize Kellogg as a marketing school and not make us as fierce a competitor. We have to push back on that by showing that we have never been just that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kellogg   s changes have come about from \u201cwalking the halls, having the meetings, talking to all the stakeholders,\u201d says Blount. \u201cWe have had nearly 40 faculty task forces over the past four years. The faculty has set the direction. The change has been paced, and it\u2019s from within.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With buy-in from faculty, Blount has streamlined 25 research centers into either one of six core departments or into four cross-disciplinary initiatives: markets and customer  architectures of collaboration  innovation and entrepreneurship  and public-private interface.<\/p>\n<p>In the last two-and-a-half years, the school has launched 55 new courses that now account for 25% of Kellogg\u2019s total offerings. There are six new courses on growth and scaling, a dozen new courses on innovation and entrepreneurship, and three new courses in data analytics that now fold into an 11-course sequence on the subject.\u201cThat kind of innovation is pretty unparalleled in academia,\u201d says Blount. \u201cIt was a huge structural and political undertaking, but we have seen great progress from it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Every month, the dean says, 10 to 15 Kellogg faculty members are being taken out to meet with the senior leadership of major corporations to connect their research with the real world and its challenges. These \u201cfaculty immersion\u201d trips have put Kellogg professors on treks all over the world. Some 30 members of the faculty have been to at least one of the BRIC countries for multiple tours in Brazil, Russia, India, and China. This year, the school may add Indonesia to the list.<\/p>\n<p>Kellogg\u2019s dive into data analytics partly stems from a Silicon Valley trip to Facebook headquarters last fall. Florian Zettelmeyer, who leads the school\u2019s program on data analytics, sat with high-placed Kellogg alumni in the valley. \u201cWe said, \u2018Here is our current curriculum. What holes do we have and where should we plug them?\u2019\u201d recalls Simonds, who was in attendance. Out of the exercise came the idea to create a course called \u201cVisualization for Persuasion.\u201d All told, Zettelmeyer has led the data analytics faculty on five immersion trips in the past year, including to IBM\u2019s data center, Nielsen Neuroscience, Cleversafe, and Civis Analytics. The professor also delivered the keynote address at General Electric\u2019s Mind &amp  Machines event last October, speaking immediately after CEO Jeff Immelt.<\/p>\n<p>Dialogues with corporations have led to a group of new courses on growth and scaling, including \u201cStrategies for Growth,\u201d \u201cScaling Operations: Linking Strategy &amp  Execution,\u201d \u201cScaling Operations Lab,\u201d Managing Organizations for Growth,\u201d and \u201cHuman Capital and Enterprise Scaling.\u201d Given the school\u2019s historic prominence in marketing, Kellogg also has such new courses as \u201cMarketing Driven Growth\u201d and \u201cMarketing Project Laboratory Course\u2014Generating Profitable Growth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The new courses have been introduced as Blount works to change the school\u2019s degree offerings. Recognizing that a growing number of professionals are interested in getting their MBA in a single year, Kellogg has put more resources into its accelerated program. This summer, the school enrolled 120 students, a 50% increase from the 80 MBA candidates that enrolled in the fast-track program when Blount arrived at Kellogg in 2010. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to slightly shrink the two-year program in a way that makes sense,\u201d says Blount. \u201cIt is about rebalancing the portfolio to meet the demands of the market.<\/p>\n<p>She also introduced an M.S. in management studies for liberal arts undergraduates who want to learn about management and business. The program, which enrolls students in mid-July and graduates them the following year in mid-May, will expand next year. For two pilot cohorts, the program was limited to Northwestern students. Blount says Kellogg will introduce the program to students outside the university next year. Though limited to just 30 students now, the dean says that the size of the program is dependent on the quality of applicants it receives. But Kellogg will move the program to downtown Chicago, where it could accommodate as many as 200 students, because \u201cwe think the energy down there is great and we can bring in executives every day, so that will enrich that program.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the school also launched a fifth international Executive MBA program with a foreign partner, the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University. More importantly, however, Blount has moved these EMBA partnerships from loose affiliations to an integrated network where schools can work closely with each other. Students in each EMBA program now take two to four courses at other network schools. \u201cWhen I got to Kellogg, those partnerships were entirely separate programs,\u201d says Blount. \u201cThe deans of those programs had never met. We created an infrastructure where the network has its own team based at Kellogg and the deans meet annually to set an agenda for each year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The school expects to continue to build on that network, with 37 exchange programs across 20 countries and a new course for full-time MBA students to be launched this spring called \u201cInternational Growth Lab.\u201d \u201cMost business schools programs take a cohort of students, ship them to a foreign country where they work on a problem, and then bring them back home,\u201d says Simonds. \u201cThis program will use the EMBA network so that our students will work together with the full-time students of our partner schools. We\u2019ll have about 20 Kellogg students in the pilot 8230 .\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Already, says Blount, 125 to 150 of Kellogg\u2019s MBA candidates are doing a quarter abroad at a partner or exchange school, while another 200 do a two-week experiential learning course abroad. \u201cAbout 50% of all our MBA students are choosing to participate in these options,\u201d says Blount.<\/p>\n<p>All of this change takes money, of course. Blount, who broke ground on a new business school building last fall, says the school has just completed a record-breaking year in fundraising. During the 2013-2014 academic year, Kellogg raised $47 million, bringing the $350 million goal of a capital campaign to $215 million.<\/p>\n<p>More money. A new building. A reconfigured brand. An entirely new senior leadership team. A radical reorganization of the faculty. New and refreshed courses. New degree offerings and a new emphasis on the growth of the one-year MBA. An expansion of the global EMBA program.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s enough change in four years to make one dizzy. Or, to borrow Kellogg\u2019s new tagline, it\u2019s the work of a leader who has inspired a great deal of growth.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/poetsandquants.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>More from Poets&amp Quants:<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/poetsandquants.com\/2014\/09\/14\/the-best-consulting-firms-to-work-for\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Best Consulting Firms To Work For<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/poetsandquants.com\/2014\/09\/04\/the-class-of-2016-by-the-numbers\/\" target=\"_blank\">The MBA Class of 2016 By The Numbers<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/poetsandquants.com\/2014\/09\/05\/what-ever-happened-to-the-mbas-on-the-apprentice\/\" target=\"_blank\">Whatever Happened To The MBAs on The Apprentice<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 05:00:55","updated":"2014-09-15 05:00:55","minute":"5:00 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/northwestern-kellogg-sally-blount\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/northwestern-kellogg-sally-blount\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/12\/130730111412-northwestern-kellogg-2.jpg?w=80&h=80&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_popular_articles","credit":"Photo: Mike Willis\/Flickr","caption":"","attach_id":"277123"},"short_title":"Inside Northwestern Kellogg B-school's ambitious growth plan","excerpt":"<p>More money, a new building, a reconfigured brand, an entirely new senior leadership team, and a radical reorganization of the faculty, all in four years.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"282031","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/john-a-byrne\/","name":"John A.

If it wanted to make credible allegations of wrongdoing, then it failed miserably.<\/p>\n<p>At issue are New Jersey laws that prevent that state   s public pension system from investing in certain types of funds whose managers have contributed to in-state political candidates or parties during the 24 months prior to receiving the commitment. In other words,    pay-to-play    restrictions designed to prevent pension officials (and their bosses) from giving new business to political patrons.<\/p>\n<p>AFL-CIO believes it has found five examples of such behavior. The problem is that at least three of them involve investment decisions made <em>before<\/em> Christie entered office. Moreover, the political contributions came years after the pension   s investments were made, and were made by individuals who don   t actually fall under the rule   s purview.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the complaint cites:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Gleacher and Company, which manages such monies even though William Sapoch, who is listed as an investment management professional with the firm, gave $3,800 in December 2012 to Christie for Governor.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nj.gov\/treasury\/doinvest\/pdf\/AnnualReport\/2013-NJPensionFund.pdf\">state investment records<\/a>, the only state pension monies managed by Gleacher &amp  Co. relate to Gleacher Mezzanine Fund II, a private debt fund that was raised back in 2006. Hard to imagine how a political donation <em>six years later<\/em> would have impacted that decision (which was made during the Corzine administration). It also is worth noting that William Sapoch appears to have been a financial advisor with Gleacher who never worked on the mezzanine business  8212  a business that actually spun out from Gleacher (and renamed itself Arrowhead Mezzanine) back in 2010.<\/p>\n<p>Here   s another:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>JP Morgan, a $3,800 contribution from Robert F. Cummings, listed as the vice chairman for Investment Banking, in January 2013 to Christie for Governor and a $15,000 to the State Republican Party by Greg Onken, who is listed as a managing director and financial advisor.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>New Jersey has multiple investments in JP Morgan-related securities but most of it is in publicly-traded equities and bonds that do not fall under the New Jersey statute (because these are passive holdings that do not involve the bank  8220 recommending investment management decisions 8221 ). The only exception is a venture capital fund investment called JP Morgan Venture Capital III, which was raised in 2006 and was not managed by either of the aforementioned JP Morgan professionals (Cummings didn   t even join JPMorgan until late 2010, while Onken is a private wealth manager).<\/p>\n<p>The one AFL-CIO example that does hold water is a 2011 investment in a venture capital fund managed by General Catalyst Partners, which had a part-timer who had made a $10,000 contribution to the NJ Republican State Committee just months earlier. That deal has been under investigation since this past May, while<em> Fortune<\/em> reported <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/nj-unloads-bakerpay-to-play\/\">earlier today<\/a> that the New Jersey Division of Investments has sold its interest in the fund. AFL-CIO also mentions State Street, in which New Jersey appears to have briefly invested in via a money market fund. It is unclear when that investment began and ended.<\/p>\n<p>But it gets worse. Here is what AFL-CIO wrote in its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.njaflcio.org\/nj_afl_cio_files_ethics_complaint_over_pay_to_play_in_pension_investments\">press release<\/a> announcing the complaint:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Many of the state\u2019s relationships with Wall Street firms coincide with generous political contributions, even though state ethics rules require a two-year lag before a donor can be a pension investor. For example, an employee of the Blackstone Group donated $10,000 to the NJ Republican State Committee in 2011, the same year new investment business was being proposed for the firm.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Blackstone employee being referred to here in Anthony Grillo, who actually left the firm back in 2005 (according to both a press release and contemporaneous media coverage). This example was not included in the actual complaint, but remains in the press release posted on the union   s website.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to in-state contributions, AFL-CIO also suggests that several hedge fund managers violated New Jersey law by committing to national political parties. Except that they didn   t.<\/p>\n<p>AFL-CIO seems to be relying on a March 2014 rules change that specifically exempted contributions to national candidates or parties from pay-to-play restrictions, whereas the earlier law was vague on the issue. What the union seems to have missed, however, was a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nj.gov\/treasury\/doinvest\/pdf\/ContributionPolicy\/PolicyAdoptedFeb06.pdf\">2006 opinion<\/a> from the NJ State Investment Council (then under Democratic Party control) that says, in part:  8220 Federal contributions were beyond the intended scope of the Council\u2019s regulations. Therefore, it was clarified that the Council\u2019s policy is limited to state committees. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>Finally there is the issue of Bob Grady, the Christie-appointed NJ State Investment Council chairman who once used to work for The Carlyle Group (a giant private equity firm that received investments from New Jersey both before and after Christie took office).

Getting ready involved more than just filling the gas tank. Ford assembled a small army of 63 people, including two doctors and two EMTs  17 support vehicles  and a nine-man camera team equipped with a helicopter and a drone for aerial shots. Some creative camouflage was also required. Fearing that competitors would get an advance peek at the design of the 2015-model truck, they built a new truck with aluminum body panels that looked exactly like an old one.<\/p>\n<p>Last year\u2019s race loop was one of the toughest in years, taking contestants over 882 miles of rocky desert tracks, dicey mountain passes, and the occasional paved road around Mexico\u2019s Baja Peninsula. Of some 300 entrants, nearly half failed to finish\u2014among them several specially built race trucks. The disguised F-150, however, completed the course in just over 36 hours, its sole casualty a broken computer module that was stepped on by a crew member. After the race the truck was driven back to Dearborn, Mich., without incident. The only parts replaced were the air filters that kept Baja\u2019s dirt and dust out of the engine.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a lot of effort to put in for a lowly pickup, a vehicle that spends most of its days on construction sites and farms and lacks the sex appeal of a Mustang or even a Fusion. But it is not misplaced. While a lot of attention has focused on outgoing CEO Alan Mulally\u2019s One Ford plan to unify the global manufacturer, the automaker\u2019s profits largely depend on a beefy truck that is sold only in North America and will never find a market in Asia or Europe. Not that it needs to. The F-series has outsold every other car and truck in the U.S. for more than three decades, a record of longevity that ranks in the hierarchy of superbrands like Coke and Marlboro. Some 33 million have been sold since the F-150 was introduced in 1950, twice as many as the Model T. If the revenue from the nearly 765,000 F-series Fords sold in 2013\u2014$31.1 billion\u2014were that of a standalone business, it would rank around 100 on this year\u2019s <em>Fortune<\/em> 500 list. Ranked by profits, such an F-series business would place even higher.<\/p>\n<p>The F-series has been the biggest beneficiary of the revolution in the pickup business. The increasing popularity of personal-use trucks has pushed average transaction prices to $40,000, and some high-end models\u2014with luxury touches like stitched leather, heated and cooled seats, and LED interior lights\u2014sell for more than $50,000. Vehicles that are mechanically simple, rarely reengineered, and sold in huge volumes, such as pickups, are automotive cash cows. Analysts figure that F-series trucks, with top-shelf trim lines like King Ranch and Platinum, generate gross profits of 40% per unit, or $12,000. In some years\u2014say, when Ford <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"F\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/f\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">F<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> broke even in passenger cars and lost money overseas\u2014profits from the F-series exceeded the company\u2019s reported net income from the auto business. It is no wonder that CEO Mark Fields refers to the F-series as the company\u2019s \u201ccrown jewels.\u201d As London analyst Max Warburton of Bernstein Research wrote, \u201cThanks to modest investments and huge volumes, there has been no greater profit machine in the history of the industry than the F-series.\u201d (A word about nomenclature: The F-series includes light-and medium-duty trucks built with a variety of engines and body configurations with designations like F-250 and F-350. The most popular model by far is the light-duty F-150 with four doors, which accounts for 69% of F-series sales.)<\/p>\n<p>What all this means is that when Ford decided in 2009 to fundamentally change the product it advertises as \u201cBuilt Ford tough\u201d by making it with a lightweight aluminum body, it was messing with a uniquely valuable franchise. Ford figured the change could reduce the weight of the F-series by 700 pounds, significantly improving its fuel economy. But aluminum is more expensive than steel, more complicated to assemble, and more difficult to repair. Customers used to crushing aluminum beer cans on their foreheads might perceive that a truck built from the same material is not as rugged as the one it replaced.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the changeover from steel would mean alterations to nearly every phase of the truck business. Aluminum can\u2019t be easily welded and must be riveted and bonded with adhesives. New suppliers would have to be found and validated, plants refitted, production techniques changed, repair technicians hired and trained. Importantly, the changeover to the 2015 models would have to be extended, slowing production and denting profits. Ford, which has stumbled launching new models in the recent past, would be confronting the most complex and highest-volume launch in its history.<\/p>\n<p>Competitors would be waiting to pounce. Like lions sharing an antelope on the Serengeti, the Detroit Three feast on the pickup-truck business. Fancier models have pushed truck transaction prices up 29% since 2005, while prices for the industry as a whole have risen only 13%, according to Edmunds.com. GM, smarting from criticism that it had been too conservative when it redesigned its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks for the 2014 model year, was offering incentives as high as $8,000 per vehicle earlier this year. With Ford carefully managing its inventory of old-style 2014 models, Fiat Chrysler put its marketing muscle behind the Ram pickup and pushed its sales up 20% in the first six months.<\/p>\n<p>Around the industry, second-guessing about Ford\u2019s aluminum truck\u2014to be launched in the fourth quarter of this year, at a price that hasn\u2019t been announced\u2014is unusually widespread. There were smirks about Ford\u2019s use of the terms \u201chigh-strength steel\u201d and \u201cmilitary grade\u201d aluminum to describe relatively ordinary materials. \u201cIt will be magic or tragic,\u201d Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation, tells <em>Fortune<\/em>. \u201cFord is going to have to build with aluminum at a volume that has never been done in the history of the automobile business.\u201d In observation of an unwritten rule in Detroit not to speak ill of competitors, most of the chatter has been sotto voce, but Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne broke the silence in May, saying, \u201cWe internally have reservations about whether aluminum is the way to go on the truck side. I think the use of aluminum in our world is better used on products other than the pickup.\u201d To use a marine metaphor, Ford was sailing into uncharted waters, and the whole industry was watching to see if it would hit any rocks.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/for11_4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-752290\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/for11_4.jpg?w=1024 038 h=682\" alt=\"ALCOA DAVENPORT WORKS IN IOWA.

He supervised its development from the beginning, and he will get the credit\u2014or blame\u2014for its performance in the marketplace. It is a venerable franchise to inherit. Henry Ford introduced the \u201cModel T Runabout With Pickup Body\u201d in 1925. Pickups first found work on farms, ranches, and job sites, but by the 1960s they had increasingly come to be used for personal transportation as well, playing featured roles in movies such as <em>Hud<\/em> and <em>The Last Picture Show<\/em>. The combination of simple construction, minimal changes, and long production runs created the industry\u2019s fattest profits.<\/p>\n<p>When Ford\u2019s product-development engineers started preprogram work in 2009 on what would become the 13th-generation F-series, two big considerations loomed in their planning: how to deliver more power and towing capability\u2014a key truck selling point\u2014while substantially increasing fuel economy. Says Fields: \u201cWe had a strong point of view on fuel prices, and we had three alternatives: make incremental changes to the existing truck, add more aluminum parts [the existing truck already had an aluminum hood], or make it all aluminum.\u201d Every manufacturer, Ford included, was racing to meet rising fuel-economy standards that required a fleetwide average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Ford had already engineered one historic change by offering a turbocharged V-6 engine called EcoBoost in its truck as a gas-saving alternative to the traditional V-8. Now it was planning to upset the status quo again.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/for11_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-752294\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/for11_2.jpg?w=1000 038 h=1000\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">FOR A SECRET SHAKEDOWN, FORD ENTERED THIS DISGUISED ALUMINUM TRUCK IN THE 2013 BAJA 1000 RACE.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">PHOTO COURTESY FOUTZ MOTORSPORTS AND FORD RACING<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Over the next 18 months Ford explored its ability to supply, build, and repair a truck with an all-aluminum body and studied customer perceptions about such a change. It created four work teams to investigate what it saw as the big unknowns surrounding aluminum: availability, manufacturability, serviceability, and likability. Scale alone made the new truck program daunting. Audi and Jaguar are using aluminum extensively, but only in low-volume, top-shelf luxury cars. Says Joe Hinrichs, the no-nonsense head of the Americas who is responsible for getting the plants ready to build the new truck: \u201cNobody has ever done 60 jobs an hour, seven days a week, with an aluminum truck.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ford is a leader in computer simulation, having pioneered its use in 1997, but the demands of the new program caused the company to rely on expensive, custom-built prototypes at each stage of development. \u201cThere was more testing for compliance and validation than we have ever done,\u201d says Mulally. As early as 2009, Ford built two rounds of prototypes as proof of concept and to gain confidence in aluminum usage. The first four vehicles were known as X0s. Like the Baja truck, they had aluminum bodies disguised to look like the 2009 production model. The next seven, called X1s, were more weight-efficient, but there were questions about their strength. So the 11th X1 prototype was subjected to the same accelerated durability tests as the steel model: a series of rocky, gouged surfaces that simulate in a few weeks 150,000 miles of wear, plus another 75,000 miles to evaluate the aluminum body.<\/p>\n<p>To its battery of standard tests, Ford added some imaginative variations. It substituted aluminum cargo boxes for steel ones on six 2010 models and gave them to three unknowing customers for blind testing: Barrick Gold, a Toronto mining company with operations in Nevada  Duke Energy  and Oregon-based Walsh Construction. The testing would continue through 2014. Ford discovered that the first aluminum gauge used for the bed was too thin to stand up to 30-to 40-pound trailer hitches tossed inside, so it increased the thickness by 50%, from 0.95 millimeters to 1.4 millimeters. Even with the thicker floor, the new box was still several hundred pounds lighter.<\/p>\n<p>As the tests were underway, top executives were getting comfortable with the idea of an aluminum truck. Mulally was an easy sell. He had led the engineering team at Boeing that had developed the aluminum-bodied 777 airliner, and his attitude was basically, \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d Fields, then president of the Americas, had a steeper learning curve. He spent time with the advance-research team to learn how aluminum could be pierced and bonded, and quickly learned to appreciate the impact of its lighter weight. At one meeting on manufacturability, he picked up a new inner door for the first time and discovered he could lift it with two fingers. His reaction: \u201cWow!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After nearly two years of upfront work, the 2015 F-series program leaders went to Ford\u2019s board of directors in October 2010 for approval to officially begin development work. A cross-functional program team was formed, the program scope defined, and initial marketing strategy approved. Stylists and engineers began work on exterior and interior design themes, while other engineers focused on chassis and powertrain development. Fields kicked off what was destined to be the biggest and costliest new-product program in Ford\u2019s 111-year history with an inspirational talk: \u201cRemember this day. This is what leaders do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In November 2012 the Ford board approved the spending for the remainder of the program: assembly-plant renovation, dealer training, and marketing and advertising expenditures. It was the last decision point  from here there would be no turning back.<\/p>\n<p>Now the team began to tackle the hundreds of individual details that require the adjustment of physical parts. First, 100 mechanical prototypes known as M1s were produced for durability and performance tests and to make sure supplier quality was in line with Ford specifications. Like the others, they were disguised as older models to fool spy photographers during road tests. Then came some 100 verification prototype (VP) trucks, built on a special assembly line. The VPs were the first units assembled with the new body, chassis, and powertrain components to test interior and exterior appearance and general performance.<\/p>\n<p>Ford was about to become a huge buyer of aluminum, and there were worries about whether supplies would be adequate. Accurately judging production volume was crucial. A few years back Ford had guessed wrong on customer demand for its small-displacement turbocharged EcoBoost engines. When the engines were introduced in 2011, it initially expected them to account for 20% of truck volume and was caught off-guard when it reached 30% after two months and eventually settled at 47% today. Fields wasn\u2019t taking any chances. In September 2013 he made a visit to Alcoa\u2019s plant in Davenport, Iowa, to see the aluminum rolls being formed. With his concerns alleviated, the program team proceeded to sign off on all engineering design validations in December 2013.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"9\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3599951275001-9\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3599951275001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1jVsUP1\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp gdfp_req=1&amp impl=s&amp output=xml_vast2&amp iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/autos_bc&amp sz=1000x1&amp cust_params=tags%3Dalcoa%2Caluminum%2Cfordf150%2Cfortune500%2Cfortune500%26ch%3Dautos%26topic%3Dfortune500&amp unviewed_position_start=1&amp correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences() \n\t\t\t<\/script><br \/>\nThe public got its first look at the new truck when Atlas, a thinly disguised design concept for the new truck, was unveiled in a pyrotechnic display at the Detroit auto show in January 2013. With bulging wheel arches and an in-your-face three-bar chrome grille, it practically snarled \u201cFord tough.\u201d But time was growing short, and attention shifted from the product to the plants. Three development assembly milestones approached: pre-launch, launch readiness, and mass-production start. Workers began to gain experience with rivets by using them as fasteners on the current truck, and Ford continued to roll out more prototypes. With production due to begin late this year at the Dearborn plant, within sight of Ford World headquarters, the company recently started building more than 100 tooling test (TT) trucks for tooling validation and manufacturing training. Sometime later this summer, 100-plus preproduction (PP) trucks will be assembled for final prototype validations and training. Like all unregistered vehicles used in development, they will eventually be crushed and recycled.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/for11_3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-752311\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/for11_3.jpg?w=900 038 h=766\" alt=\"25th annual North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan.\" width=\"900\" height=\"766\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">New CEO Mark Fields (right) with predecessor Alan Mulally (left) and executive chairman Bill Ford.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">PHOTO BY TANNEN MAURY\u2014EPA\/CORBIS<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Not all the action was in Detroit. As far back as 2008, Ford began work to ensure that 90% of its customers would be no more than a two-hour drive from a collision-repair specialist who knew how to work with aluminum. \u201cJoe Customer who lives in a small town in Oklahoma has to know where he goes to get it fixed,\u201d says Jim Farley, head of marketing, sales, and service. When there were no dealers nearby, Ford reached out to independent body shops. Naturally, the training program was conducted in total secrecy. Participants were told to expect to spend $30,000 to $50,000 on new equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Early in the development process, marketers had been figuring out how to sell a more expensive truck made out of this lightweight new metal. The thrust became clear early on: Ignore the improved efficiency, and convince customers it was more capable than the old truck. Truck buyers, in Ford\u2019s view, care mostly about towing and payload. Hence the tag line \u201cThe future of tough.\u201d Ford figures that 20% of its potential customers are skeptical and will need to be convinced.<\/p>\n<p>At the Dearborn Truck Plant, one of two assembly plants where the F-150 will be built\u2014the other one is just outside Kansas City\u2014the company is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build and install new stamping presses and dies to produce the aluminum panels and replace today\u2019s spot welders with rivet guns, advanced welders, and adhesive machinery in the body shop. With both plants currently producing the 2014 F-150, they will have to be taken down one at a time for a total of 13 weeks for refitting, depriving Ford of perhaps $2 billion in revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Ford has guessed wrong on a new truck before. When the 1997 F-150 was redesigned from the ground up for the first time since 1980, it got uncharacteristic rounded styling\u2014a \u201cjellybean look\u201d\u2014that allowed for improved aerodynamics, a larger interior, and better fuel economy. Designed to \u201chit the hot buttons\u201d of baby boomers, it sold quickly at first (1.1 million in 2001), but the style didn\u2019t catch on, and Ford retreated back to a chiseled box look in 2004.<\/p>\n<p>There are three big questions yet to be answered about the new F-series: how close did Ford come to its 700-pound weight-reduction target? How great is the impact on performance and fuel economy? And how much more will Ford be able to charge customers? Analysts warn that Ford\u2019s outsize profits may be a thing of the past. Says Bernstein\u2019s Warburton: \u201cThe need to fit more expensive powertrains and use lightweight materials to meet fuel-economy regulations [the next F-series may have to shed 700 pounds] will permanently dent F-series profitability.\u201d Pickup owners\u2019 loyalty is legendary, so the F-series\u2019 three decades of sales leadership most likely aren\u2019t in jeopardy. But nobody wants to be known as the person who lost\u2014or even tarnished\u2014the crown jewels.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#ff0000 \">View the evolution of the F-Series in the <em>Fortune<\/em>

Wal-Mart thinks small, this retailer says bigger is better","content":"<p>With traffic falling at physical stores and e-commerce sales continuing to shine, brick-and-mortar retailers have been soul searching as they plot their future in an increasingly digital world.<\/p>\n<p>Some, such as Sears Holdings and J.C. Penney, are scaling back by closing underperforming stores. Others, including Wal-Mart, have nimbly <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/08\/14\/walmart-small-stores\/\" target=\"_blank\">responded by opening smaller stores<\/a>. Nearly all talk about their  8220 omnichannel 8221  initiatives \u2014 a term meant to highlight sales generated through the mix of brick-and-mortar, online and mobile channels.<\/p>\n<p>But home d\u00e9cor retailer At Home is sticking with a more traditional method: big-box retailing. It operates 75 stores with an average of 120,000 square feet and hopes to expand to 600 locations across the U.S. The bet on big physical stores is for now an all-in strategy, as At Home doesn   t operate an online store.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 We win on assortment, 8221  At Home Chief Executive Lee Bird said.  8220 We need the size to do that. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>Bird believes the retailer   s massive stores give customers plenty of options to peruse for the two hours (on average) they spend in the stores. For example, At Home stocks roughly 600 rugs in its stores, while primary competitors carry 60.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 When other people are editing and editing and editing and customers are getting less choices, we are going the other way\u2013more choices, 8221  Bird said.<\/p>\n<p>At Home stocks a variety of styles, ranging from classic to modern, and sells pretty much every home item imaginable 8211 furniture, patio and garden items, housewares. Formerly known as Garden Ridge, the Dallas-based retail chain is in the process of a $20 million renovation to clean up its own home by adding fresh paint, new signage and bathrooms.<\/p>\n<p>That effort, which the company started in January, will be completed in September and moves away from a name (people thought it was exclusively a garden store) and color scheme (the orange in the old signage was the same as Home Depot) that confused customers.<\/p>\n<p>At Home says store traffic and sales have risen at stores that have undergone a facelift, bucking a trend among some national competitors that have struggled to lure customers into their stores. The privately held company declined to provide annual sales figures, but Bird said all stores are profitable and new stores being built are profitable in their first year.<\/p>\n<p>The retailer is expanding into a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/246242\/retail-sales-of-the-us-home-furnishings-industry-by-product-type\/\" target=\"_blank\">multi-billion industry<\/a> with a variety of well-established competitors, battling against Wal-Mart, Target, Bed Bath &amp  Beyond and HomeGoods and many others. But At Homes is also well positioned on a number of fronts. Like Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, it is highly exposed to the rebounding housing sector. That segment also faces less pressure from online competitors, as customers like to see furniture and other home items in person to get a better sense of sizing and coloring.<\/p>\n<p>At Home also utilizes an  8220 everyday low price 8221  strategy so a vast majority of goods are sold at their original marked price. At Home competes on pricing by keeping a lid on a variety of costs. Rents are low, it doesnt spend a lot on advertising, and physical stores are used as warehouses to stock merchandise.<\/p>\n<p>At Home   s second-generation big-box strategy is particularly unique. It scoops up old stores from Target, Sears, Sam\u2019s Club and other retailers and repurposes them for its own use.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 The economics of going into somebody else   s box when they   ve decided to leave works out well for us, 8221  said Bird.<\/p>\n<p>At Home is planning to open 20 new stores next year, accelerating from the 16 that should open in 2014. E-commerce also presents a potential growth opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>But for now, At Home is busy stocking its massive stores to help inspire long visits.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 Our focus is making sure we have something for everybody, 8221  Bird said.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 14, 2014","published":"2014-09-14 12:02:24","updated":"2014-09-14 12:02:24","minute":"12:02 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/14\/at-home-big-box\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/14\/at-home-big-box\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/athome.jpg?w=80&h=80&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_popular_articles","credit":"Photo courtesy of At Home","caption":"Home d\u00e9cor retailer At Home is planning to expand to 600 stores.","attach_id":"780283"},"short_title":"As Wal-Mart thinks small, this retailer says bigger is better","excerpt":"<p>Home d\u00e9cor retailer At Home is sticking with a more traditional approach: big-box retailing<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"275462","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/john-kell\/","name":"John Kell","twitter":"johnnerkell\u00a0","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"55\" height=\"55\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/john-kell-369.jpg?w=55\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"JOHN KELL\" \/>","bio":"","title":"","company":""}],"sections":[{"term_id":9548,"name":"Features","slug":"features","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46733,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and in-depth looks at topics of interest to the Forune audience, with a focus on storytelling and context of the news you need to know.","parent":0,"count":3610,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":13879,"name":"Retail","slug":"retail","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46735,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and updates on the retail sector, including companies like Wal-Mart, Target, Costco, Sears, Home Depot, and other places to shop.","parent":0,"count":573,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":10585,"name":"Small Business","slug":"small-business","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46732,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News about how to grow, build, and sustain your small business - news from Fortune Magazine about small business.","parent":0,"count":249,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Retail","slug":"retail","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/category\/retail\/"},"tags":[{"term_id":10151,"name":"At Home","slug":"at-home","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":115504,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":10893783,"name":"brick-and-mortar retailers","slug":"brick-and-mortar-retailers","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":49009,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":18,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":13879,"name":"Retail","slug":"retail","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46786,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":109,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":18996,"name":"Wal-Mart","slug":"wal-mart","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":59633,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":51,"filter":"raw"}],"primary_tag":{"name":"At Home","slug":"at-home","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/at-home\/"},"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"Home d\u00e9cor retailer At Home is sticking with a more traditional approach: big-box retailing","seo":{"seo_title":"As Wal-Mart thinks small, this retailer says bigger is better","seo_description":"As national chains accelerate small-store openings, At Home keeps building larger stores","seo_keywords":"","seo_news_keywords":"At Home, retail, Wal-Mart, home decor","seo_additional_meta":""},"social":{"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2014%2F09%2F14%2Fat-home-big-box%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F1sZpev3","encoded_title":"As+Wal-Mart+thinks+small%2C+this+retailer+says+bigger+is%C2%A0better","twitter_text":"As Wal-Mart thinks small, this retailer says bigger is\u00a0better","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"As national chains accelerate small-store openings, At Home keeps building larger stores","facebook_title":"As Wal-Mart thinks small, this retailer says bigger is better"},"format":{"term_id":2710,"name":"Article","slug":"fortune-post-format-article","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"fortune_post_format","description":"","parent":0,"count":6161,"filter":"raw"},"related_posts":[]},{"id":785783,"url":"\/2014\/09\/15\/frontier-and-dish-put-a-10-million-spotlight-on-small-towns\/","title":"Frontier and DISH put a $10 million spotlight on small towns","content":"<p>Matt Ledoux is a 34-year-old seafood entrepreneur in Coos Bay, Oregon, a small coastal town of 16,000 people. It\u2019s a place in need of some investment. The trains run slow because of its aging tracks. The city\u2019s real estate needs a makeover. The fishing industry is lagging on equipment. But it\u2019s a town with a thriving community, and Ledoux has some ideas: To grow imports of Dungeness crab and Albacore tuna, Coos Bay has to expand the capacity of its sluggish port. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to upgrade our import and export terminals in order to move container ships in and out of our harbor a little faster,\u201d said Ledoux, a former president of Coos Bay\u2019s chamber of commerce.<\/p>\n<p>But Ledoux, whose Fisherman\u2019s Wharf market sells local seafood, thinks Coos Bay has a shot in a new competition that just might make some of that investment come to life. Ledoux is assembling a group from the city\u2019s nonprofits, business chambers and other groups to formulate a business plan and apply for the America\u2019s Best Communities competition, a $10 million contest that kicked off this week as a partnership between Frontier Communications and DISH Network to stimulate growth and revitalization in small cities and towns.<\/p>\n<p>If Ledoux\u2019s team is successful, they stand a chance at winning a multi-million dollar prize, which Ledoux says they plan to invest in updating Coos Bay\u2019s infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>The contest, the first of its kind, is aimed at cities and small towns with a population of 9,500 to 80,000 in the 27 states Frontier serves, and is intended to reward the communities that have the best ideas to build, sustain and grow their local economies. The contest kicked off last week with a launch event in Gardnerville, Nevada 8211 as well as smaller events in markets including Charleston West Virginia, Terre Haute, Indiana and Dallas, Pennsylvania 8211 but Frontier is hoping that thousands of communities will take part in the initiative.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a rare spotlight on rural communities at a time when cities are all the rage. But Frontier is deeply rooted in the rural markets of the U.S. Maggie Wilderotter, CEO of Frontier, sees the competition as an important catalyst to improve many towns and communities in the U.S., especially the smaller-sized markets that often get overlooked. \u201cOne of the things that we are trying to do is to create a multiplier effect,\u201d said Wilderotter. \u201cSo with our $10 million investment, you sort of get this rising tide to lift all boats.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Under the terms of the contest, communities have until January 2015 to pitch their business plans. From there, 50 communities will be shortlisted, and each one will be granted $35,000 as \u201cseed investment.\u201d For the next seven months, those 50 will fine tune their ideas and submit their final proposals in September 2015. In early 2016, eight finalists will be awarded $100,000 each to put their plans into practice. And lastly, the top three winners from that group of finalists will receive a total of $6 million in October 2017. (Smaller sponsors will donate the remaining funds for equipment including GoPro cameras, which will be given to communities to document their meetings.)<\/p>\n<p>Wilderotter herself is a champion of small markets, telling Fortune that when she feels \u201cdepressed\u201d in fast-paced Washington D.C., where she currently lives, she likes to visit her smaller, more laid-back markets, which she says inspire her. \u201cI see how the local governments where they have mayors and city councils that work side by side with businesses and communities,\u201d she said. \u201cI see these tight-knit communities where people know each other and help each other.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That focus on small communities led Frontier to partner with DISH, the satellite television and broadband service provider that serves 14 million subscribers across the US, including in many remote areas of the country. DISH CEO Joseph Clayton told Fortune he feels the small communities across the US have been the backbone of America. \u201cThey just need some investment to bring innovation to the forefront,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The two companies hired an outside firm to create the contest, and as part of the research process, representatives from both companies visited rural communities in Michigan, Oregon and Illinois, where they saw a lot of promise\u2014young people speaking passionately about innovative ideas to better their communities\u2014but projects lagged in the absence of funding.<\/p>\n<p>It was important to the companies that the contest reward communities that are designing their own projects with their own people. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be heavy handed,\u201d says Steve Crosby, senior vice president of corporate communications for Frontier.<\/p>\n<p>While going through the city of Coos Bay, the research team met Ledoux, the seafood seller. They asked him who would benefit more from the contest, governments or business communities. Ledoux vouched for business\u2014\u201cbecause entrepreneurs are very good at taking $1 and turning it into $10.\u201d The prize will be awarded to community development ideas with a business focus, like renovating a public park and hosting a concert there, or opening cafes with bookshops.<\/p>\n<p>With Oregon the top destination for intra-state moves last year, the business prospects of the entire state have increased, which means more potential business for both Frontier and DISH. Indeed, by strengthening the tax base of these smaller cities and towns and improving the quality of life, it\u2019s also injecting capital into areas with the hope of turning them into growth markets for both companies.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe think this is good business for us,\u201d said Wilderotter. \u201cIt\u2019s in our best interest.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a small city like Coos Bay, the arrival of new residents has already brought some change. Breweries are popping up. The timber and fishing industries are drawing new businesses. If Coos Bay ends up as one of America\u2019s Best Communities, it could be a game changer. Says Ledoux: \u201cThere is a very real chance that we   ll have necessary resources to accomplish our dreams. 8221 <\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 12:52:15","updated":"2014-09-15 12:52:15","minute":"12:52 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/frontier-and-dish-put-a-10-million-spotlight-on-small-towns\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/frontier-and-dish-put-a-10-million-spotlight-on-small-towns\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/184088184.jpg?w=80&h=80&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_popular_articles","credit":"Photo by Michal Bryc\u2014Getty Images","caption":"","attach_id":"784468"},"short_title":"The two communications companies launch a competition for \"America's Best Communities\" ","excerpt":"","authors":[{"id":"555574","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/mehboob-jeelani\/","name":"Mehboob Jeelani","twitter":"jeelanireports","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img alt='' src='http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/?s=59 038 d=identicon 038 r=G' class='avatar avatar-59' height='59' width='59' \/>","bio":"","title":"","company":""}],"sections":[{"term_id":4236,"name":"Management","slug":"management","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46727,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and advice on management, leadership, jobs, careers, CEOs and anyone who aspires to the C-suite.","parent":0,"count":6106,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":3225,"name":"Real Estate","slug":"real-estate","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":47384,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":99,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":10585,"name":"Small Business","slug":"small-business","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46732,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News about how to grow, build, and sustain your small business - news from Fortune Magazine about small business.","parent":0,"count":252,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":1,"name":"Uncategorized","slug":"uncategorized","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":1,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":18,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Management","slug":"management","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/category\/management\/"},"tags":[{"term_id":4253322,"name":"The New Metropolis","slug":"the-new-metropolis","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":110726,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":9,"filter":"raw"}],"primary_tag":{"name":"The New Metropolis","slug":"the-new-metropolis","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/the-new-metropolis\/"},"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"Matt Ledoux is a 34-year-old seafood entrepreneur in Coos Bay, Oregon, a small coastal town of 16,000 people.

She is describing a slightly creepy \u201cbiofabricated\u201d product made by a startup the foundation funded with a $350,000 donation. The company, named Modern Meadow, makes leather and, indeed, meat by taking skin or muscle samples from animals via biopsy and then growing them in vitro. Modern Meadow is just one of 19 futuristic startups that have received donations from the Thiel Foundation over the past two years as part of an unusual program called Breakout Labs. Though it is rare, if not unheard-of, for a charitable foundation to donate tax-advantaged dollars to for-profit companies, the Thiel Foundation is no ordinary charity. It was set up in 2006 by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, who crafts his gifts to make a point, as he explains to <em>Fortune<\/em> in an interview. \u201cYou want to pick an issue where it both does some good on its own,\u201d he says, \u201cand at the same time helps draw awareness to a broader set of issues.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Breakout Labs shines a spotlight on a contrarian contention Thiel has been advancing in essays, talks, and debates since about 2008, which has come to be known as the \u201ctech stagnation thesis.\u201d Thiel contends that the amazing advances we have seen in computer science and communications have masked ominously disappointing progress in energy, transportation, biotech, disease prevention, and space travel. That slowdown, he maintains, accounts for the near stagnation in real incomes and wages we have experienced since 1973, and for widening inequality in wealth distribution.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the last 40 years in the technology world,\u201d as Thiel puts it, \u201cwe\u2019ve had enormous progress in the world of bits, but not as much in the world of atoms.\u201d The notion is encapsulated in the tag line of Thiel\u2019s venture capital firm, Founders Fund: \u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To address this problem, his Breakout Labs supports only \u201chard tech\u201d startups\u2014ventures that aren\u2019t focusing on websites, social media, or information technology\u2014and those that are too speculative to attract angel investors or even government grants. He gives these companies a shot of capital with which to try to prove that their technology works in hopes that they will then be able to attract conventional VC funding\u2014as Modern Meadow managed to do this past June.<\/p>\n<p>A gifted rhetorician and provocateur with a bottomless pocketbook, Thiel has drawn upon his wide-ranging and idiosyncratic readings in philosophy, history, economics, anthropology, and culture to become perhaps America\u2019s leading public intellectual today, assuming a mantle once held by the likes of Thorstein Veblen or Norman Mailer. The conspicuous difference is that Thiel\u2014a libertarian, gay Christian\u2014espouses views that are far harder to anticipate, and he has earned his pulpit largely through commercial rather than literary or scholarly masterworks.<\/p>\n<p>In 1998, Thiel co-founded the pioneering e-commerce payments company PayPal, which was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Among students of business, PayPal may be known less for its own success than for the subsequent achievements of the people Thiel helped attract to build it. Those individuals, now known as the PayPal mafia, went on to launch a raft of companies that have become household names, including at least seven now valued at more than $1 billion: Tesla <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"TSLA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/tsla\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">TSLA<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and SpaceX (co-founded by Elon Musk), LinkedIn <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"LNKD\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/lnkd\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">LNKD<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> (Reid Hoffman), YouTube (Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim), Yelp <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"YELP\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/yelp\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">YELP<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> (Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons), Yammer (David O.

In 2004 he famously gave the 20-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard sophomore who had never held a steady job, $500,000 in exchange for 10.2% of the company then called Thefacebook. The investment has so far netted Thiel more than $1 billion in cash  he retains a $200 million stake and remains a Facebook director. Other notable Thiel investments, either individually or through Founders Fund, have included LinkedIn  Spotify  a $120 million stake in Musk\u2019s rocket-ship company, SpaceX  and more recently Airbnb.<\/p>\n<p>Thiel\u2019s public profile began extending beyond the Valley in 2010, when he was depicted in the movie <em>The Social Network<\/em>. This year HBO\u2019s <em>Silicon Valley<\/em> television series introduced the world to a brilliant eccentric named Peter Gregory, who is widely understood to have been inspired by Thiel. In the first episode Gregory delivers a speech promoting a program almost identical to Thiel\u2019s controversial \u201c20 Under 20\u201d project, launched in late 2010, which annually offers 20 young tech phenoms $100,000 if they\u2019ll drop out of school to launch a startup.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-779856\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_5.jpg?w=990 038 h=660\" alt=\"HBO Silicon Valley\" width=\"990\" height=\"660\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">At left, the eccentric tycoon character Peter Gregory in HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley is thought to be based on Thiel.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Jaimie Trueblood\u2014HBO<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Later this month Thiel\u2019s fame will probably balloon further when he publishes <em>Zero to One: Notes on Startups<\/em>, or <em>How to Build the Future<\/em>. The title refers to the distinction Thiel draws between transformative, \u201cvertical\u201d change\u2014going from zero to one\u2014and incremental, \u201chorizontal\u201d change\u2014going from one to n. \u201cIf you take one typewriter and build 100, you have made horizontal progress,\u201d he explains in the book\u2019s first chapter. \u201cIf you have a typewriter and build a word processor, you have made vertical progress.\u201d (<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/peter-thiels-the-challenge-of-the-future\" target=\"_blank\">Read excerpt here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe book is nominally about entrepreneurship,\u201d Zuckerberg observes in an interview with <em>Fortune<\/em>, \u201cbut what I actually think it\u2019s about is the philosophy of how you go about creating value in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Zero to One<\/em> is based on what Silicon Valley digerati knowingly refer to as \u201cCS183\u201d\u2014the catalogue designation for the undergraduate computer science course Thiel taught during Stanford\u2019s spring 2012 trimester. Thiel\u2019s lectures became an online sensation after Stanford law student Blake Masters, then 25, began posting\u2014originally without permission\u2014reconstructions of each one on his Tumblr blog.<\/p>\n<p>After his fourth installment became the subject of a <em>New York Times<\/em> op-ed column by David Brooks, Masters recalls, he decided to check with Thiel to see if he minded. \u201cGo ahead and keep posting,\u201d Thiel emailed back. Masters\u2019 blog has since received close to 2.4 million page views from 560,000 unique visitors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe course notes have had a huge impact,\u201d venture capitalist Marc Andreessen tells me. \u201cEvery entrepreneur we meet has read those back to back.\u201d Andreessen co-wrote the code for the first modern web browser and co-founded the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.<\/p>\n<p>When Thiel decided to write the current book\u2014a pared-down, more elegant treatment of the same material, with some additions\u2014he turned for help to Masters, who is now listed as the book\u2019s co-author.<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, perhaps, Masters has also now founded his own startup, a software-turbocharged legal analytics tool. Thiel led its $2 million seed round.<\/p>\n<p>Thiel, 46, is more youthful, energetic, and fit than his on-screen impersonators. At our first interview he is dressed in a black V-neck sweater, khakis, and high-end sneakers. He has invited me to breakfast\u2014a vegetable omelet for me, just fresh berries for him\u2014prepared by his private chef at his airy, contemporary headquarters amid the eucalyptus-scented hills of San Francisco\u2019s Presidio. Picture windows afford views of the Palace of Fine Arts against the backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge, Angel Island, and Alcatraz.<\/p>\n<p>Though Thiel has become a living emblem of Silicon Valley, he has actually lived and worked in San Francisco since late 2002. He moved here from Mountain View, after selling PayPal, to chart a new beginning.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEntrepreneurs who are very successful always run the risk of competing with their past selves,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you win a gold medal in the Olympics, my bias would be you should quit swimming that day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an extraordinary statement from someone who has so obviously thrived on competition all his life. A couple of chess sets stand at the ready barely 10 yards from where we\u2019re chatting. These are not the intricately carved, ornamental keepsakes of a collector, but rather the regulation Staunton sets of a master-level player, with timer clocks alongside.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, devaluing competition is a central theme of Thiel\u2019s new book. He asserts that \u201ccapitalism and competition are opposites,\u201d because \u201cunder perfect competition, all profits get competed away.\u201d He exhorts entrepreneurs to seek out monopolies, concluding, \u201cAll happy companies are different: Each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: They failed to escape competition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Andreessen, a friend and frequent co-investor with Thiel, says he agrees with \u201cexactly half\u201d of whatever Thiel says, and that Thiel\u2019s denunciation of competition is a good example. \u201cHe\u2019s right, in that you should try to do something that nobody\u2019s competing with,\u201d says Andreessen. \u201cBut he\u2019s wrong in that, if it\u2019s a good idea, there are going to be other people doing it. And then what? Gonna give up? Well, no. You\u2019re going to compete.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Andreessen credits Thiel with having a positive impact on Valley culture. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be around Peter and not think, \u2018I have to get smarter,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWhen it comes to philosophy, history, politics, the fate of humanity\u2014Peter has up-leveled the discussion a lot. Before Peter, not a lot of people were thinking about these topics. People were thinking, \u2018What\u2019s the new chip?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Born in October 1967 in Frankfurt, West Germany, Thiel grew up as a gifted outsider. His father was an engineer whose jobs required the family to move often\u2014to America, then to Africa, then back\u2014forcing Thiel to change elementary schools seven times. The family took root in the Bay Area in 1977, when Thiel was 10.<\/p>\n<p>Thiel began playing chess when he was 6, and by age 12 was ranked seventh in the U.S. in the under-13 category. (He continued to play tournament chess into his thirties and still plays \u201cblitz chess\u201d\u2014five-minute games\u2014over the Internet.) He also excelled in math, scoring first in a California-wide mathematics test while attending public school in San Mateo.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_1.jpg\"><img class=\" aligncenter size-full wp-image-779852\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_1.jpg?w=533 038 h=723\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"723\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Thiel was born in Frankfurt, West Germany, in 1967, to an engineer father whose international travels required Thiel to change elementary schools seven times.

It was also modifying its traditional Great Books curriculum to accommodate the then-ascendant multiculturalist critique. Pushing back against \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d in 1987, Thiel co-founded the Stanford Review, a journal of conservative and libertarian viewpoints, and was its first editor-in-chief.<\/p>\n<p>In college Thiel became captivated by the teachings of the French anthropological philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard, who was on Stanford\u2019s faculty. Girard has written extensively about a concept he calls \u201cmimetic desire\u201d\u2014our unconscious tendency to adopt the aspirations of our neighbors. In Girard\u2019s world imitation engenders competition, and competition engenders imitation.<\/p>\n<p>For Thiel, a contrarian by nature who later became a hedge fund manager, startup founder, and venture capitalist\u2014all posts requiring an ability to reject herd mentalities, shun market bubbles, and seize overlooked opportunities\u2014Girard\u2019s analysis of man\u2019s unconscious compulsion to imitate his fellow man was compelling. \u201cIt\u2019s been a powerful way of thinking for all these different contexts I\u2019ve found myself in over the years,\u201d says Thiel.<\/p>\n<p>Thiel now also identifies a more personal reason he was likely attracted to Girard in college: his own unconscious imitation of those around him. Thiel had then passively boarded a conveyor belt that would carry him from college to Stanford Law School, and thence to a position as a young transactional lawyer at New York\u2019s Sullivan &amp  Cromwell, a position near the pinnacle of that profession.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it was the unhappiest period of my whole life,\u201d recounts Thiel of his time at Sullivan. \u201cIt lasted seven months and three days.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There he endured a \u201cquarter-life crisis\u201d that appears to have shaped his mistrust of higher education. \u201cI enjoyed law school,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t ask the question of why I was doing this nearly enough. In retrospect, I was too competitive.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Upon leaving the law firm, Thiel became a derivatives trader at CS Financial Products, a unit of Credit Suisse. He found that more congenial, he says, but it still had a \u201ctracked character\u201d that felt wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Around Christmas 1994, while visiting his family on the West Coast, he spent a few days with his college friend Reid Hoffman. Though Hoffman had considered Thiel \u201cextremely right wing\u201d at Stanford and had then counted himself a socialist, the two had become fast friends, each placing great value on their intellectual sparring over philosophy, morality, and politics.<\/p>\n<p>Hoffman had aspired to become a public intellectual, by writing books and essays as a philosophy professor, but now he was tweaking his plan. \u201cI realized,\u201d he says in an interview, \u201cthat if you generalized what a public intellectual does to [creating] media objects\u201d\u2014i.e., not just books and essays\u2014\u201cthen one could possibly create software companies that had public intellectual impact.\u201d These would have \u201cthe strength of commercial models,\u201d he explains, and therefore also have the advantage of letting one \u201cplay the economic thing\u201d\u2014i.e., make money.<\/p>\n<p>As Thiel recalls the meeting, \u201cWe were thinking about all the different tech companies one could start, and there was a sense that something important was happening and it made sense to try to do something here,\u201d that is, in Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<p>Thiel made the break in early 1996, leaving New York for Menlo Park. He raised $1 million from friends and family and started his own hedge fund, Thiel Capital.<\/p>\n<p>A year later he met Luke Nosek, then 21, who was one of several engineers who\u2019d just left the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for Silicon Valley, following in the footsteps of Marc Andreessen. Hoping to launch a web-based calendar, Nosek asked Thiel for advice about fundraising. To his surprise, Thiel offered to invest $100,000 from his own fund, and did.<\/p>\n<p>The company failed. Nosek was racked with guilt at having lost Thiel\u2019s money: \u201cI just thought, \u2018Oh, my God. My friend. He offered to invest.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nosek\u2019s friend Max Levchin, another UIUC programmer, then asked Nosek to introduce him to Thiel so that he could pitch his idea for a cryptography-related company called Fieldlink. Nosek was still too ashamed to even speak to Thiel, so Levchin went behind his back, collaring Thiel after a talk he gave at Stanford. Thiel liked Levchin\u2019s idea and proposed becoming a co-founder. He and Levchin then asked Nosek to join them too.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd this is what\u2019s great about Peter,\u201d Nosek says. \u201cHe does not take friendship lightly. It\u2019s something that lasts slightly longer than forever. I was like, \u2018Oh, I screwed this thing up.\u2019 But it didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t like it. He was mad. But it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Fieldlink changed directions and names a couple of times and became PayPal. In picking their team, Thiel and Levchin brought in only people whom at least one of them knew very well. Thiel persuaded Reid Hoffman to become a board member and also brought in David Sacks, who had been an editor-in-chief of the <em>Stanford Review<\/em> a few years after Thiel, as chief operating officer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeter was never a nuts-and-bolts operations guy,\u201d writes Sacks in an email. \u201cBut he had a knack for identifying all the big strategic issues and getting them right.\u201d In March 2000, he recalls, PayPal was raising a $100 million financing. Puffed up with the bravado of the dotcom bubble, most people wanted to hold out for better terms. \u201cPeter kicked everyone\u2019s butt to get the round closed,\u201d Sacks continues. \u201cA couple of days later the market crashed. Had we waited another week, the company would have died.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-779853\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_2.jpg?w=490 038 h=314\" alt=\"Peter thiel, Elon Musk\" width=\"490\" height=\"314\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Thiel (left) and Elon Musk in October 2000, about seven months after they merged the competing companies they had founded, forming PayPal.

Thiel\u2019s take was about $55 million. He then started planning his second act, which would embrace three subplots: relaunching his hedge fund, becoming a venture capitalist, and founding a new billion-dollar company.<\/p>\n<p>In 2003, as Act II was getting underway, Thiel took care of an awkward task. He told some friends and associates that he was gay. Word spread quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s still one of these things that people in our society find incredibly important and interesting about other people,\u201d he says, with what sounds like annoyance.<\/p>\n<p>Some critics have suggested that the revelation exposed hypocrisy in certain of Thiel\u2019s earlier writings. During his years at the <em>Review<\/em>, he had been deeply skeptical of \u201cidentity politics.\u201d In 1995 he and Sacks published a book called <em>The Diversity Myth<\/em>, in which they argued that in the campus context, \u201cthose persons complaining about oppression are generally not the ones to have experienced it firsthand.\u201d In one disturbing passage they come to the defense of a law student friend who in 1992 had shouted an antigay slur outside the cottage of a gay resident fellow as a protest against campus speech codes. The authors argue that the law student\u2019s near-universal execration afterward, official and unofficial, was disproportionate to his offense.<\/p>\n<p>Asked about this incident in 2011, Thiel told <em>The New Yorker<\/em> that he regretted having written about it. \u201cAll the identity-related things are in my mind much more nuanced,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cI think there is a gay experience, I think there is a black experience, I think there is a woman\u2019s experience that is meaningfully different. I also think there was a tendency to exaggerate it and turn it into an ideological category.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In our interviews, Thiel said that he had not fully realized he was gay when he wrote the book. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have known,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I was somehow incredibly confused about it.\u201d Thiel has had a steady boyfriend for a number of years now, he says, but he preferred not to have additional details published.<\/p>\n<p>(To close the circle of pain, the former law student who shouted the antigay slur has also recently acknowledged a homosexual relationship. How does he look back at the 1992 incident? \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt was 22 years ago.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>Thiel put $10 million of his PayPal winnings into the hedge fund and relaunched it as Clarium Capital. \u201cThe big, macroeconomic idea that we had at Clarium\u2014the id\u00e9e fixe\u2014was the peak-oil theory,\u201d Thiel says, \u201cwhich was basically that the world was running out of oil, and that there were no easy alternatives\u2014either more oil or conservation or alternative energy.\u201d It was the first glimmer of his tech stagnation thesis.<\/p>\n<p>On the venture capital side he began angel-investing with his friend Hoffman. The two invested in social network startups, beginning with Hoffman\u2019s own LinkedIn in 2003 and culminating in the 2004 Facebook stake.<\/p>\n<p>Also in 2004, Thiel launched a new startup\u2014one whose business model was viewed as so outr\u00e9 that it initially attracted no Silicon Valley funding. At first its only backer, besides Thiel, was a not-for-profit called In-Q-Tel, which is the venture arm of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBasically,\u201d Thiel explains, \u201cI thought that some of the approaches that PayPal had used to fight fraud\u201d\u2014which at one point posed an existential threat to PayPal\u2014\u201ccould be extended into other contexts, like fighting terrorism.\u201d After 9\/11, he says, \u201cyou end up with this ideological debate which is sort of Vice President Cheney vs. the ACLU: Will we have more security with less privacy, or less security with more privacy? And my worry is that, whenever a terrorist attack happens, the ACLU will always lose.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What was missing from the debate, Thiel argues, was the recognition that with technological advances, \u201cyou could have more security with fewer privacy violations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/cov22_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-779878\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/cov22_2.jpg?w=750 038 h=1000\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">A master level chess player today, Thiel was, at age 12, ranked seventh in the U.S. in his age category.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Art Streiber for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So\u2014and, yes, many find this a shocking project for a libertarian to embark upon\u2014he founded Palantir, which would provide data-mining services to government intelligence agencies, but services that were, he insists, maximally unintrusive and traceable. Ten years later the market for its services has proved broader than many predicted, with more than 60% of its revenue last year coming from private sector clients. The company\u2019s last funding round valued it at $9 billion.<\/p>\n<p>After launching his venture capital firm, Founders Fund, in 2005, Thiel was ready in 2006 to kick off the Thiel Foundation, through which he channels his heuristic charitable giving. It gives away about $13 million to $15 million a year.<\/p>\n<p>An early beneficiary was Aubrey de Grey, the highly controversial biogeronotologist who founded the SENS Research Foundation, which stands for Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence. De Grey is trying to develop regenerative therapies that can postpone aging\u2014possibly indefinitely. In an email, De Grey confirms to me that he still believes, as he was once quoted saying, that the first human who will live to be 1,000 is probably already alive today.<\/p>\n<p>Thiel\u2019s support for anti-aging research is perhaps the most extreme manifestation of his being a \u201cdefinite optimist\u201d\u2014a person who, as Thiel defines the term in <em>Zero to One<\/em>, believes \u201cthe future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it better.\u201d Thiel contrasts such a person to an indefinite optimist, someone who thinks \u201cthe future will be better, but \u2026 doesn\u2019t know how exactly, so he won\u2019t make any specific plans.\u201d Thiel abhors the latter outlook, which he feels predominates in America.<\/p>\n<p>A second notorious Thiel charity is the Seasteading Institute, which he co-founded in 2008 with the aim of launching floating cities outside the reach of existing governments. In our conversations, however, Thiel spoke of this project almost in the past tense, noting that \u201cit\u2019s quite hard to do, both technologically and culturally.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thiel\u2019s most infamous charitable project has probably been his 20 Under 20 program, which provides gifted students between the ages of 18 and 20 with $100,000 to launch their own startups. The program empowers \u201cdefinite optimists,\u201d but also highlights Thiel\u2019s view that we are in an \u201ceducation bubble,\u201d in which colleges saddle undergraduates with needless debt by tricking them into thinking their degrees will be worth more than they really will be.<\/p>\n<p>There has been pushback. Former Harvard president Larry Summers called the program \u201cthe single most misdirected philanthropy in this decade,\u201d according to TechCrunch, while Slate Group chairman Jacob Weisberg wrote in <em>Newsweek<\/em>, \u201cThiel fellows will have the opportunity to emulate their sponsor by halting their intellectual development around the onset of adulthood, maintaining a narrow-minded focus on getting rich as young as possible and thereby avoid the siren lure of helping others or pursuing knowledge for its own sake.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For all the controversy, it\u2019s a narrow program. \u201cIt\u2019s classic Peter,\u201d says Andreessen. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people in the academy freaking out like it\u2019s the death knell for organized education,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s 20 kids a year.

Though he experienced some rough sledding, he got through it.<\/p>\n<p>His hedge fund did get clobbered. Thiel\u2019s peak-oil thesis did well by Clarium until mid-2008, as the price of oil soared from about $40 a barrel in 2002 to nearly $140. During that stretch the fund swelled in value from about $10 million to more than $6 billion as stock valuations skyrocketed and new investors flocked to his door.<\/p>\n<p>But by February 2009 oil prices had temporarily fallen back to almost $40 again. And though Thiel had foreseen the real estate bubble, he still underestimated it. \u201cWe didn\u2019t fully believe our own theories about how bad things were,\u201d he admits.<\/p>\n<p>Worse, he overreacted and missed the rebound, causing Clarium to badly underperform in 2009 and 2010. Most institutional investors fled. Today Clarium\u2014with about $200 million under management\u2014handles just the money of Thiel, friends and family, and a few select investors.<\/p>\n<p>His flagship VC arm, on the other hand, Founders Fund, has fared very well. Its funds under management have grown from $50 million in 2005, when it closed its first fund, to $2 billion today, after its fifth fund closed in March. According to one limited partner who has been involved in every Founders Fund pool since 2007, performances have ranked in the \u201ctop quartile, if not the top decile\u201d of all VC funds of their vintage (i.e., the category determined by the year the fund closed), with annual returns in the 35% to 45% range.<\/p>\n<p>Though the 2008 financial crisis buffeted Thiel\u2019s world, it also made people more receptive to his \u201ctech slowdown thesis,\u201d Thiel says. Still, Thiel\u2019s hypothesis remains only that. Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, who has debated the issue with Thiel at Oxford, wrote that \u201cthe vast majority of my scientist colleagues at top universities seem awfully excited about their projects in nanotechnology, neuroscience, and energy, among other cutting-edge fields. They think they are changing the world at a pace as rapid as we have ever seen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At first glance, the optimism of Thiel\u2019s <em>Zero to One<\/em>, exhorting entrepreneurs to embark upon transformative acts of creation, might seem at odds with the pessimism of his tech stagnation theory. But the latter is actually the motivational backdrop for the former.<\/p>\n<p>When people look into the future, Thiel explains to me, the consensus is that globalization will take its course, with the developing world coming to look like the developed world. But people don\u2019t focus on the dark, Malthusian reality of what that will mean, absent major technological breakthroughs not currently in any pipeline.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf everyone in China has a gas-guzzling car, we\u2019ll have oil at $10 per gallon and enormous pollution,\u201d he observes.<\/p>\n<p>But that   s just the start, because without growth there will also be increasing political instability. Instability will lead to global conflict, and that in turn may lead to what in a 2007 essay he referred to as 8221  secular apocalypse 8221 \u2014total extinction of the human race through either thermonuclear war, biological contagion, unchecked climate change, or an array of competing Armageddon scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d he says, with characteristic understatement and aplomb, \u201cI think the stakes in this are not just, \u2018Are we going to have some new gadgets?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>This story is from the September 22, 2014 issue of Fortune.<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 4, 2014","published":"2014-09-04 07:03:50","updated":"2014-09-04 07:03:50","minute":"7:03 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/peter-thiels-contrarian-strategy\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/peter-thiels-contrarian-strategy\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"10\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3765744600001-10\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3765744600001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1u0vOEg\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp gdfp_req=1&amp impl=s&amp output=xml_vast2&amp iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/finance_bc&amp sz=1000x1&amp cust_params=tags%3Dadamlashinsky%2Cbubble%2Cfoundersfund%2Cipo%2Cpeterthiel%2Crogerparloff%2Ctechbubble%2Czerotoone%26ch%3Dfinance%26topic%3Dpeterthiel&amp unviewed_position_start=1&amp correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences() \n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-home_popular_articles","caption":""},"short_title":"Peter Thiel's Contrarian Strategy","excerpt":"<p>The tech financier and intellectual provocateur has some ideas that may turn you off.

Why? Workers who care for the elderly and disabled in their homes are \u201can easy target for holding down costs,\u201d she says. \u201cCollectively, as a society, we haven\u2019t valued the work they do in the way we should.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a problem in and of itself, and it has been amplified by the fact that <a href=\"http:\/\/phinational.org\/sites\/phinational.org\/files\/phi-facts-5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the home care industry is the fastest-growing sector of the American economy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Two occupations make up the home care aide profession: personal aides who provide clients with self-care and help them with everyday tasks, and home health aides who assist the disabled, chronically ill, or cognitively impaired and may administer medication or check clients\u2019 vial signs. Put together, about 2 million Americans hold these jobs. (The PHI estimates that there are likely hundreds of thousands of uncounted aides employed by individuals and families.)<\/p>\n<p>The wages these workers earn are painfully low: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/ooh\/healthcare\/personal-care-aides.htm#tab-1\" target=\"_blank\">the median salary for a personal care aide is $19,910 annually<\/a>, or $9.57 an hour  a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/ooh\/healthcare\/home-health-aides.htm#tab-1\" target=\"_blank\">home health aide earns $20,820 or $10.01 per hour<\/a>. As America\u2019s population ages, these professions are expected to grow by 49% and 48%, respectively, from 2012 to 2022, eclipsing the average growth for all occupations: 11%. They are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/emp\/ep_table_103.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the second- and third-fastest growing occupations<\/a> in the nation\u2014behind only industrial-organizational psychologist, a job that brings in median annual wages of $83,750. On the BLS   s list of 30 fastest-growing jobs, personal and home care aides are the worst paid.<\/p>\n<p>It   s no surprise, then, that the home care industry is plagued by high turnover rates, which <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leadingage.org\/uploadedFiles\/Content\/About\/Center_for_Applied_Research\/Publications_and_Products\/Direct%20Care%20Workers%20Report%20%20FINAL%20%282%29.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the Institute for the Future of Aging Services<\/a> pegged at between 40% and 60% for a home health aide who has been on the job for less than a year.<\/p>\n<p>Take all these factors into account and you\u2019ve got the makings of a public health crisis, says Ai-Jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, an advocacy group. \u201cIn light of the Age Wave\u2014the Silver Tsunami\u2014the high rates of burnout, and poverty wages that no one wants to work for\u2014it\u2019s not good for the general public,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>Home care workers, who are employed by third-party agencies or by clients directly, have long been exempt from minimum wage and overtime laws. That will finally come to an end in January, when a Department of Labor regulatory change will grant most home care workers wages of at least $7.25 per hour and overtime.<\/p>\n<p>The ramifications of the new rule illustrate, as Poo puts it, \u201cthe pattern and practice of discrimination\u201d against home care workers. At the time of the rule\u2019s announcement, it promised to give home care workers in 29 states minimum wage and overtime protections for the first time, <a href=\"http:\/\/nelp.3cdn.net\/4c5e433c3fed691479_utm6bpbna.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">according to the National Employment Law Project<\/a>. Many of these states have minimum wage and overtime laws for other workers, of course, but some of them have over the course of their history carved out exemptions for in-home care providers. That means that in some states home care workers will earn the federally mandated $7.25 an hour for the first time in January, but if their state has a higher minimum wage that excludes in-home workers, they won\u2019t be eligible for the higher rate. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nelp.org\/page\/content\/state_table#Alaska\">Alaska, for instance<\/a>, enforces a minimum wage of $7.75 but it also has an exemption for \u201cdomestic service\u201d employees, so most home care workers in that state will be subject to the federal $7.25 rate come January, not the state\u2019s higher wage.<\/p>\n<p>At the federal level, home health care workers aren\u2019t covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which only covers \u201cfacility\u201d workers, according to PHI. And anti-discrimination laws, such as the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, generally only cover employers with multiple employees, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.epi.org\/files\/2013\/bp369-in-home-workers-shierholz.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">says the Economics Policy Institute,<\/a> meaning some in-house workers are excluded.<\/p>\n<p>Home health workers employed by individual households aren\u2019t eligible for workers\u2019 compensation, family and medical leave, and can\u2019t enroll in a 401(k), PHI says.<\/p>\n<p>In the hierarchy of workers, home health care workers are at the bottom, below even low-paid fast-food workers, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/fast-food-workers-strike-wages\/\" target=\"_blank\">whose recent strikes and protests<\/a> have drummed up public empathy. This is by no means a new development.<\/p>\n<p>During the negotiations of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which instituted minimum wage and overtime laws as part of the New Deal, members of Congress from southern states refused to sign onto the bill if domestic and farm workers\u2014industries made up largely of African Americans at the time\u2014were included, according to Peggie Smith, a labor and employment law professor at Washington University School of Law. So these workers were left out of the legislation as it became law.<\/p>\n<p>During the Progressive Era, Smith says, this work was regarded as having little value since it was considered an ideal training ground for women who would soon be married. And the work itself was seen as easy and stress-free. By 1940, Smith says, 26 states had minimum wage laws, but only Wisconsin\u2019s applied to women doing domestic work, including home care. Likewise, by 1941, 43 states enforced maximum-hour laws that protected women, but only one of them covered women engaged in domestic work, Smith says.<\/p>\n<p>The demographics of the home care industry continue to put it at the short end of the pay and benefits stick. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s not a group with a lot of power,\u201d says Marquand. <a href=\"http:\/\/phinational.org\/sites\/phinational.org\/files\/phi-facts-5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">According to PHI<\/a>, 91% of home care aides are female, 56% are non-white minorities, 24% of them are foreign-born, and 58% have a high school education or less.<\/p>\n<p>Seventy-three percent of the $61 billion home health care services industry is paid for with public funds, primarily through Medicaid. A common argument against raising home care workers\u2019 wages is that an increase would leave states without the funds to provide in-home care for all of the elderly and disabled individuals who need it. <a href=\"http:\/\/medicaiddirectors.org\/sites\/medicaiddirectors.org\/files\/public\/namd_ltr_to_dol_flsa_rule_140423.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The National Association of Medicaid directors, for instance, cited such concerns<\/a> when it sought to delay the regulatory change giving home care workers minimum wage rights in April. Smith points out that the same argument could be made about the pay of other publicly funded employees, like police officers, fire fighters, and hospital workers.<\/p>\n<p>Labor efforts provided these workers with a brief glimmer of hope. Since 2010, workers in New York, California, Hawaii, and Massachusetts won the passage of domestic workers\u2019 bills of rights that typically provide for days of rest, overtime, and protection against discrimination. Another notable victory came in Washington state earlier this month <a href=\"http:\/\/seiu775.org\/clc2014\/\" target=\"_blank\">when the home care workers there, represented by the Service Employees International Union<\/a>, negotiated a contract with the state that will give them average hourly pay of more than $14 per hour.<\/p>\n<p>But a recent Supreme Court ruling has thrown a wrench into those efforts. In <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/06\/30\/supreme-court-public-unions\/\" target=\"_blank\">a 5-4 ruling in June<\/a>, the justices recognized a category of \u201cpartial public employees\u201d that cannot be forced to contribute union fees. The decision put the brakes on the unions\u2019 efforts to recruit home care aides, a ballooning pool of potential members.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow does one move forward with organizing in spite of this case? 8221  Smith says.  8220 People are still trying to figure that out.\u201d Something has to give, and fast.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor seniors and people with disabilities, it\u2019s already hard to find a good direct care worker,\u201d says Joe Caldwell, director of long-term services and support policy for the National Council on Aging. \u201cThe number of people needing care is going to double in decade, and fewer workers are going to be willing to work for nothing.\u201d<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 05:00:51","updated":"2014-09-15 05:00:51","minute":"5:00 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/home-care-workers\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/home-care-workers\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/452088476.jpg?w=80&h=80&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_popular_articles","credit":"Bonnie Jo Mount\u2014The Washington Post\u2014Getty Images","caption":"A home health aide helps a patient in Washington, DC.","attach_id":"786066"},"short_title":"The worst paying fastest-growing job in America","excerpt":"<p>Historical discrimination, demographics, and public funding have left home care workers at the very bottom of the American work hierarchy.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"381338","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/claire-zillman\/","name":"Claire Zillman","twitter":"clairezillman","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"55\" height=\"55\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/claire-zillman-759.jpg?w=55\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"FORTUNE MAGAZINE DITORS HEADSHOTS - PHOTO EDITOR NEIL HARRIS\" \/>","bio":"","title":"","company":""}],"sections":[{"term_id":20466,"name":"Careers","slug":"careers","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46729,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News you can utilize to develop and advance your career and how to position yourself to get that great new job.

This is the 11th year that the Pumpkin Spice Latte (the PSL, in the parlance of aficionados) has graced the menu at Starbucks <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"SBUX\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/sbux\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">SBUX<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>. With more than 200 million PSLs sold, it\u2019s the company\u2019s most popular seasonal beverage. Rival coffee purveyor Dunkin\u2019 Donuts has more than a half dozen pumpkin-flavored items on the menu this year. The company says it spends time strategizing how it can ramp up the \u201cpumpkin-osity\u201d of its offerings.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-full\"><img src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/127527320.jpg\" alt=\"127527320\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Pumpkins<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Pumpkin Background: Getty Images<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>As most consumers are well aware, we are not speaking merely of coffee. Just about anything that can have a pumpkin variety now does, or soon will: Oreos, Milano cookies, M&amp Ms, yogurt, marshmallows, gum, oatmeal, Eggo waffles. There was even buzz last week, which turned out to be a hoax, about a pumpkin spice condom. The fact that this fake news gained so much traction is a sign of how sexy the subject has become.<\/p>\n<p>Or perhaps it was an ironic commentary on the ubiquity of a once-humble member of the squash and melon family. Indeed, some have begun to complain of pumpkin spice fatigue (let\u2019s call it PSF) out of one side of their mouths\u2014but data on eating habits suggest they   re still sipping PSLs out of the other. Since 2006, industry tracker Mintel has found that pumpkin as a beverage ingredient has grown 130% on U.S. menus. Since 2004 the use of pumpkin as a flavor in food on menus has increased ten-fold.<\/p>\n<p>So what\u2019s driving the flavor to these new heights? <em>Fortune<\/em> decided to investigate the consumer psychology behind pumpkin spice.<\/p>\n<p>Both Starbucks and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts executives point to the seasonality and nostalgia evoked by the flavor. \u201cIt\u2019s a beverage that captures the essence of fall,\u201d says Peter Dukes, who led the PSL   s development as a Starbucks product manager. His colleague Cliff Burrows, group president of the U.S., Americas, and Teavana, thinks its success is linked to the combination of the return to school after the long summer holiday and the closure of the season with Labor Day. \u201cThere\u2019s something about that whole turning point, which is so significant,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice way to turn the corner on the year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s all well and good, but it doesn\u2019t really explain why pumpkin spice outperforms other seasonal flavors. Starbucks\u2019 eggnog latte and peppermint mocha both predate the PSL but haven\u2019t entered the zeitgeist to nearly the same extent. Before landing on the PSL, Dukes said that Starbucks also considered a cinnamon streusel latte, a flavor that seems unlikely to have garnered as much attention or traction.<\/p>\n<p>One reason pumpkin spice may be so popular is that it taps into a paradox of human desire: We like new things, but we also want things we know we\u2019ll like, explains Harry Balzer of consumer market research company NPD Group. Balzer says that pumpkin pie is the second most-consumed pie in America (apple is No. 1), which is astonishing considering it\u2019s essentially eaten only one day a year. That gives us the illusion that we   re eating a new flavor, and helps explain why Dunkin\u2019 and Starbucks likely won\u2019t ever offer pumpkin year round. Doing so would erode its mystique.<\/p>\n<p>Alan Hirsch, founder and director of the Smell &amp  Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago, thinks that there might be something physical going on. Hirsch, whose findings and <a href=\"http:\/\/articles.chicagotribune.com\/2014-01-19\/health\/ct-met-sensa-weight-loss-hirsch-20140119_1_hirsch-journals-studies\">research are not without controversy<\/a>, has done work with Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and sister brand Baskin-Robbins although not involving pumpkin. In one of his studies, he looked at the effects of 30 different scents on the sexual arousal of 31 male volunteers (yes, you read that correctly). He found that the scent causing the highest level of arousal was a combination of lavender and pumpkin pie. Doughnut and black licorice came in second, and the combination of doughnut and pumpkin pie came in third. Ironically, cranberry, the other big marker of Thanksgiving, came in last.<\/p>\n<p>One of Hirsch\u2019s hypotheses is that in our current culture, in which there\u2019s been a loss of traditions, people are seeking out forms of comfort and security that they had as children. The smell of pumpkin spice brings them back to those moments. He also believes its ascent might stem from an aging society. As you grow older, you lose your sense of smell, but cinnamon, a major ingredient in pumpkin pie, is something that continues to cut through.<\/p>\n<p>But part of pumpkin spice   s allure to consumer products companies is that it\u2019s become a safe bet. \u201cIt\u2019s a flavor line that\u2019s appealing across all age groups,\u201d says MaryAnne Drake, a professor of sensory analysis and flavor chemistry at North Carolina State University. \u201cIt transcends demographics.\u201d Companies have caught on to the fact that Starbucks, a brand popular with millennials, has had major success with pumpkin spice, but the flavor is not too cutting edge that their parents won\u2019t drink it. Drake notes that there\u2019s been a push in food research to examine the role emotions play in what we eat. That has encouraged the proliferation of pumpkin spice offerings, since they evoke warm feelings.<\/p>\n<p>Pumpkin spice   s popularity might not have anything to do with, well, pumpkin, argues Hedy Kulka, senior flavorist with International Flavors &amp  Fragrances.  8220 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s so much the pumpkin part, 8221  says Kulka, who admits to preferring a Starbucks eggnog latte to the PSL.  8220 If you sold pumpkin people wouldn\u2019t want it. It   s the background note. 8221  What   s driving pumpkin spice   s appeal is the inclusion of cinnamon and nutmeg\u2014two spices that coffee shops have been putting out on counters for customers to use for years, she notes. \u201cThey\u2019re so familiar to Americans,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody is putting cardamom out there for you to use.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are two possible futures for pumpkin spice: a world in which we max out on the flavor and the bubble pops. Or it might become even more <em>ubiquitous<\/em> to the point where we don   t even think about it.  8220 I see this as something that is not necessarily a novelty anymore, 8221  says Kulka. Soon, pumpkin may become so common that it\u2019s just like plain old vanilla.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 06:00:46","updated":"2014-09-15 06:00:46","minute":"6:00 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/pumpkin-aphrodisiac\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/pumpkin-aphrodisiac\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"11\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3784708541001-11\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3784708541001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/X7c6Kr\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp gdfp_req=1&amp impl=s&amp output=xml_vast2&amp iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&amp sz=1000x1&amp cust_params=tags%3Dpsl%2Cpumpkinspicelatte%2Cstarbucks%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dstarbucks&amp unviewed_position_start=1&amp correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences() \n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-home_popular_articles","caption":""},"short_title":"Is pumpkin spice the ultimate aphrodisiac?","excerpt":"<p>Science says it just might be.

The article below was originally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3373185\/roger-goodell-resignation-pressure-ray-rice\/\" target=\"_blank\">Time.com<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>BY Nolan Feeney, TIME<\/p>\n<p>National Football League commissioner Roger Goodell is facing mounting calls for his resignation amid the league\u2019s handling of a recently published video tape of Ray Rice, which shows the Baltimore Ravens running back knocking his fianc\u00e9e unconscious in an elevator.<\/p>\n<p>Rice was given a two-game suspension in July for violating the league\u2019s personal-conduct policy after he was arrested on charges related to domestic violence for the incident. In August, Goodell apologized for the leniency of the punishment and announced <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3210301\/the-easiest-call-of-roger-goodells-career\/\" target=\"_blank\">stricter punishments<\/a> for abusers, but two events put him back in the hot seat last week: first, security footage of the actual assault that surfaced on TMZ  and second, an Associated Press report that law enforcement <a href=\"http:\/\/bigstory.ap.org\/article\/ap-newsbreak-source-says-rice-video-sent-nfl\" target=\"_blank\">had sent the footage to the NFL the footage five months ago<\/a>. Goodell has said that nobody in the organization saw the video footage until last week.<\/p>\n<p>But women\u2019s groups have mounted a growing campaign for Goodell\u2019s resignation. UltraViolet, a women\u2019s-rights organization, announced plans to fly planes with banners featuring the message \u201c#GoodellMustGo\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2014-09-12\/-goodell-must-go-banners-to-fly-above-nfl-stadiums-on-game-day.html\" target=\"_blank\">over three different NFL stadiums on Sunday<\/a>, Bloomberg News reports. The planes are expected fly for two hours over stadiums in San Francisco, Cleveland and East Rutherford, N.J., before the facilities\u2019 no-fly-zone rules kick in an hour before games begin. Another plane is scheduled to fly over a stadium in Indianapolis on Monday ahead of another NFL game there that night.<\/p>\n<p>Terry O\u2019Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women, said in a statement earlier in the week that Goodell\u2019s resignation was the only solution for the league to \u201ctransform the culture of violence against women that pervades the NFL,\u201d citing the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/32 2 \/ray-mcdonald-arrested-domestic-violence-49ers\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ray McDonald<\/a> (arrested in August on felony domestic-violence charges) and the Carolina Panthers\u2019 <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3329416\/greg-hardy-nfl-domestic-violence\/\" target=\"_blank\">Greg Hardy<\/a> (arrested in May for assaulting an ex-girlfriend) as other examples. Hardy had been due to play for the Panthers Sunday, but was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2014\/09\/14\/us\/nfl-domestic-violence-greg-hardy\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">placed on the inactive list<\/a> shortly before the game.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe NFL sets the example for college, high school, middle school and even elementary school football programs,\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/espn.go.com\/nfl\/story\/_\/id\/11500445\/terry-oneill-president-national-organization-women-calls-nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-resign\" target=\"_blank\">O\u2019Neill said in a statement<\/a>, according to ESPN. \u201cAnd the example it is setting right now is simply unacceptable. New leadership must come in with a specific charge to transform the culture of violence against women that pervades the NFL. That\u2019s the only way to restore honor and integrity to the country\u2019s most lucrative and popular pastime.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A number of lawmakers have also weighed in. Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota <a href=\"http:\/\/thehill.com\/blogs\/in-the-know\/in-the-know\/217126-dem-senator-nfl-commissioner-should-consider-resigning\" target=\"_blank\">told the <em>Hill<\/em><\/a> that Goodell should \u201cseriously\u201d consider resignation. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called for \u201cstronger stiffer penalties against criminal assault and domestic violence\u201d no matter who was in charge of the league, while Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland \u201cwasn\u2019t prepared\u201d to say whether Goodell should resign but called for the NFL \u201cto be a leader\u201d in addressing domestic violence.<\/p>\n<p>The hashtag #GoodellMustGo has also taken off on Twitter, where an advertisement for CoverGirl\u2019s NFL line with the slogan \u201cGet your game face on!\u201d was modified to show a model with a black eye, <a href=\"http:\/\/ftw.usatoday.com\/2014\/09\/photoshop-nfl-covergirl-model-black-eye-twitter\" target=\"_blank\"><em>USA Today<\/em> reports<\/a>, and widely shared.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">John Mara, the president and CEO of the New York Giants, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/sports\/football\/john-mara-supports-roger-goodell-cries-commish-resignation-article-1.1935194\" target=\"_blank\">said in a supportive statement Wednesday<\/a> that Goodell took responsibility for Rice\u2019s initial two-game suspension and had made a positive change in the league: \u201cOur policy now on domestic violence has been strengthened.

We now have a strong partnership with anti-domestic violence groups, and we will be a better league for it going forward.\u201d He also said the NFL had made \u201crepeated requests\u201d to obtain

New Jersey unloads investment related to Charlie Baker 'pay-to-play' allegations","content":"<p>The New Jersey Division of Investments has quietly sold its stake in a venture capital fund managed by General Catalyst Partners, following allegations of impropriety related to a political contribution from General Catalyst \u201cexecutive-in-residence\u201d and current Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker.<\/p>\n<p><em>Fortune<\/em> has learned that the sale agreement was inked back in August, and closed within the past several weeks. It may be publicly disclosed tomorrow during an open State Investment Council meeting, and was discussed during an investment policy committee call last week. No word yet on the buyer, although a source says that the sale price was around 1.5x of cost.<\/p>\n<p>Here was a brief backgrounder on the situation that we wrote <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/05\/16\/charlie-bakers-big-mistake\/\">back in May<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In April 2011, Baker joined Cambridge, Mass.-based venture capital firm General Catalyst as an \u201cexecutive-in-residence\u201d (XIR). One month later, he made a $10,000 donation to The New Jersey Republican State Committee, apparently in reciprocal gratitude for help that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie gave Baker during a failed 2010 gubernatorial run. Four months later, General Catalyst began soliciting capital for a new fund from New Jersey\u2019s state pension system. The pension\u2019s investment staff recommended a $20 million commitment that December, with General Catalyst ultimately agreeing to accept $15 million (the fund was oversubscribed, so not all investors could get their desired allocations).<\/p>\n<p>And then nobody paid any attention until late last week, when Pando <a href=\"http:\/\/pando.com\/2014\/05\/08\/exclusive-christie-officials-gave-millions-in-taxpayer-funds-to-major-tech-vc-in-apparent-violation-of-pay-to-play-rules\/\">published a piece<\/a> suggesting that the aforementioned timeline violated both state and federal \u201cpay-to-play\u201d rules. Baker\u2019s campaign and General Catalyst both have defended their actions as perfectly legal, largely arguing that \u201cexecutives-in-residence\u201d like Baker are not subject to pay-to-play restrictions because Baker was not an actual General Catalyst employee, let alone someone with decision-making power.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In that same post, we suggested that Baker and General Catalyst likely were in compliance with SEC rules but that he may well have violated the more-stringent New Jersey law.<\/p>\n<p>One week later came word that NJ pension officials asked state attorneys to review the situation, with the job ultimately falling to the Treasury Department   s auditor. That report has not yet been finalized or provided to the SIC, which chose to sell the fund position anyway.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 If the report finds that there was a violation, then [DOI] would be forced to sell and might not be able to get the same price, so it made sense to sell now, 8221  explains a source who was on the investment policy committee call. It remains unclear if the sale negates public release of the auditor   s report.<\/p>\n<p>The General Catalyst fund includes investments in such companies as Snapchat and Warby Parker.<\/p>\n<p>A spokeswoman for General Catalyst declined to comment, except to say that the firm has been cooperating with New Jersey. A NJ Treasury spokesman declined comment, while a Baker campaign spokesman has not yet returned a request for comment.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 09:35:23","updated":"2014-09-15 09:35:23","minute":"9:35 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/nj-unloads-bakerpay-to-play\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/nj-unloads-bakerpay-to-play\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ap381637735614.jpg?w=80&h=80&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_popular_articles","credit":"Photo by Stephan Savoia\u2014AP","caption":"Charlie Baker","attach_id":"787782"},"short_title":"","excerpt":"<p>New Jersey has sold its stake in a venture capital fund that has invested in such companies as Snapchat and Warby Parker, after allegations of cross-state influence peddling.

But this much is clear: As our military machine hums into a higher gear, it will produce some winners in the defense industry.<\/p>\n<p>New fights mean new stuff, after all. And following the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014and the belt-tightening at the Pentagon imposed by steep budget cuts\u2014military suppliers are lining up to meet a suddenly restored need for their wares. Presenting his vision for expanding the confrontation with the terrorist group ISIS in a speech to the nation on Wednesday night, President Obama outlined a program of intensified airstrikes designed to keep American troops away from the danger on the ground. So defense analysts are pointing to a pair of sure-bet paydays from the new campaign: for those making and maintaining the aircraft, manned and unmanned, that will swarm the skies over the region, and for those producing the missiles and munitions that will arm them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe drone builders are going to have a field day,\u201d says Dov Zakheim, who served as Pentagon Comptroller during the George W. Bush administration. That could mean a tidy profit for privately held General Atomics, maker of the Predator drone, the granddaddy in the category and still widely in use, as well as the second-generation Reaper, designed to carry 3,000 pounds worth of bombs. And to help survey vast expanses of desert, the military will rely on the Global Hawk, made by Northrop Grumman <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"NOC\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/noc\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">NOC<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> to hover at altitudes as high as 50,000 feet for up to four days at a time. Those vehicles will likely be making use of the Gorgon Stare. This sensor, developed by privately held Sierra Nevada, is capable of scoping a 4-kilometer diameter by filming with nine cameras.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the widening conflict could even reverse the trend of tapering investments in the technology, says Mark Gunzinger, a retired Air Force colonel and former deputy assistant secretary of defense now at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. \u201cOne of the things that can help a new capability break through is an operational stressor, like a major air campaign,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Smaller players in the space will also get in on the action: Zakheim called out AeroVironment <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AVAV\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/avav\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AVAV<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, which manufactures unmanned aerial vehicles small enough to be launched by hand\u2014including the Nano Hummingbird, made to look like its namesake and similarly diminutive, weighing less than a couple of double A batteries. And Jason Gursky, an analyst who covers the industry for Citigroup, identified DigitalGlobe <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"DGI\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/dgi\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">DGI<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, a satellite company whose biggest business is selling non-classified digital imagery to federal agencies. The military will use that range of surveillance capability to pinpoint targets as it broadens its mission.<\/p>\n<p>It is the munitions makers, however, who stand to reap the biggest windfall, especially in the short term. Topping that list is Lockheed Martin <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"LMT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/lmt\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">LMT<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, producer of the Hellfire missile, a precision weapon that can be launched from multiple platforms, including Predator drones. Raytheon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"RTN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/rtn\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">RTN<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, which makes the Tomahawk, a long-range missile launched from the sea, and General Dynamics <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GD\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/gd\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GD<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, which also has a munitions business, are also well-positioned, analysts say.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe most obvious cases are what I would call the boots, beans, and bullets trade,\u201d says Ronald Epstein, a Bank of America analyst, pointing to \u201cthe guys with shorter backlogs.\u201d That is, shipbuilders can\u2019t expect much work from this conflict, but those supplying the ordnance American forces are already churning through should see new orders. Gunzinger notes that \u201csmall diameter bombs could be a huge winner, since aircraft can carry more of them in a single sortie\u2014and they have very accurate seekers, so they can strike targets with less potential for collateral damage.\u201d Tally up another advantage for Raytheon\u2019s product line, among others.<\/p>\n<p>American military operations targeting ISIS have cost some $600 million since mid-June, with the U.S. now spending more than $7.5 million a day on the conflict by the Pentagon\u2019s own accounting. Zakheim estimates that this figure could conceivably double as the operations intensify and the theater widens to Syria, with a significant chunk of the expenditures going to munitions.<\/p>\n<p>The total price tag for the open-ended conflict, expected to be measured in years rather than months, is anybody\u2019s guess. In the immediate term, however, the White House is pressing Congress to approve $500 million to fund the training and equipping of pro-Western rebel groups in Syria. That alone could mean extra work for a wide array of prime defense contractors, according to Gursky.

It costs honest citizens thousands of dollars per year and saps trust in public and private institutions.<\/p>\n<p>We   ve all experienced corruption on at least a small scale at some point in our lives, but actually measuring it is difficult. Recently, <em>Fortune <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/06\/10\/most-corrupt-states-in-america\/\">covered a study by two public policy researchers<\/a>\u2014Cheol Liu of the City University of Hong Kong and John L. Mikesell of Indiana University\u2014who looked the rate at which public employees in each of the 50 U.S. states had been convicted on federal corruption charges from 1976 to 2008 to determine which state was the most corrupt in the union.<\/p>\n<p>Their conclusion? Mississippi, The Hospitality State, has not been all that hospitable to its citizens over the past 30-plus years, according to the study. The state had the highest ratio of public workers who were censured for misuse of public funds and other charges.<\/p>\n<p>The researchers looked at the hard numbers\u2014federal convictions\u2014to control for differences in spending on law enforcement and the rigor of state corruption laws.<\/p>\n<p>While these numbers don   t lie, Mississippi officials were none too pleased to top this list. As the state   s top corruption fighter, Mississippi State Auditor Stacey Pickering argued in an interview with <em>Fortune<\/em> that the study relied on old data and didn   t take into account the state   s anti-corruption efforts.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 This is dated material that goes back to 1976 until 2008, the year I was sworn into office, 8221  said Pickering.<\/p>\n<p>Pickering argued that many Mississippi laws have changed since then, with the state legislature putting in an investigative arm into the state auditors office.  8220 I   m the only state auditor in the entire country that has a law enforcement function. I   ve actually got a division in my office of gun totin   , badge wearin    CPAs, lawyers, and investigators, 8221  he said.<\/p>\n<p>This allows Pickering to more aggressively pursue white-collar criminals. Pickering also argued that, since he often works with federal officials when pursuing crooked public servants, the fact that his state has convicted more than its fair share could be a sign not just of greater corruption but simply that Mississippi has taken a tougher stand against it.<\/p>\n<p>Pickering has a point. Since the study goes back 30 years and doesn   t examine trends in these sorts of crimes, it   s quite possible that the worst of Mississippi   s corruption is in the past. The paper also didn   t look at the structure of governance to see how states were responding to corruption. Pickering points to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publicintegrity.org\/2012\/03\/19\/8423\/grading-nation-how-accountable-your-state\">another study done<\/a> by Rutgers University   s Center for Public Integrity, which ranked Mississippi as the sixth <em>least <\/em>corrupt state in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>To be sure, the Rutgers study and the Liu-Mikesell analysis were measuring two different things. The Liu-Mikesell paper looked at actual convictions, while the Rutgers study took a subjective look at laws, regulations, and governance structure to grade each state on how hospitable they were to corruption. But of course there   s more the problem than laws on the books. You can take a tough stance against corruption with strong laws and lots of funding for law enforcement, but if the culture of a place is more prone to corruption, it may take a long time for those efforts to yield any benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Also, even though Mississippi ranked as the 6th least corrupt state in the country, Rutgers    Center for Public Integrity <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stateintegrity.org\/mississippi\">only gave the state<\/a> an overall C+ grade  meaning, if anything, the state   s laws are only good by comparison.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, Mississippi should be praised for efforts it has recently taken to combat the malfeasance that has been so prevalent in its state. As Pickering pointed out, his office received the National State Auditor Association (NSAA) Excellence in Accountability Award for a Special Project in 2012, for its efforts to minimize fraud during both the post-Katrina rebuilding efforts and during the spending of the 2009 stimulus package money. Pickering   s office will also receive the David M. Walker Excellence in Government Performance and Accountability Award, sponsored by the National Intergovernmental Audit Forums and the Government Accountability Office for its efforts in fighting fraud during times when the federal government was spending big dollars in the state.<\/p>\n<p>But at the end of the day, any way you cut it, Mississippi has had far too many corruption convictions over the past 30 years. The state is making strides, however, and perhaps in a decade we   ll see the fruits of that labor.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 28, 2014","published":"2014-07-28 09:49:28","updated":"2014-07-28 09:49:28","minute":"9:49 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/07\/28\/most-corrupt-us-state-mississippi\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/07\/28\/most-corrupt-us-state-mississippi\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/welcome_to_mississippi_2012_06_24_005.jpg?w=80&h=80&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_popular_articles","credit":"Thomas R Machnitzki\/Wikimedia","caption":"","attach_id":"637213"},"short_title":"America's most corrupt state defends itself","excerpt":"<p>A recent study put Mississippi as the nation   s most corrupt state, but officials argue that it doesn   t take into account its recent anti-corruption efforts.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"348221","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/chris-matthews\/","name":"Chris Matthews","twitter":"crobmatthews","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"55\" height=\"55\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/chris-matthews-781.jpg?w=55\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"CHRIS MATTHEWS\" \/>","bio":"","title":"","company":""}],"sections":[{"term_id":4236,"name":"Management","slug":"management","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46727,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and advice on management, leadership, jobs, careers, CEOs and anyone who aspires to the C-suite.","parent":0,"count":6105,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Management","slug":"management","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/category\/management\/"},"tags":[{"term_id":205998,"name":"anti-corruption","slug":"anti-corruption","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":112579,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":22388,"name":"corruption","slug":"corruption","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":109976,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":10,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":3898,"name":"Crime","slug":"crime","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":110364,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":5,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":16505,"name":"governance","slug":"governance","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":113878,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":2,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":46227,"name":"law enforcement","slug":"law-enforcement","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":113879,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":2,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":59351,"name":"Mississippi","slug":"mississippi","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":113877,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"}],"primary_tag":{"name":"corruption","slug":"corruption","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/corruption\/"},"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"A recent study put Mississippi as the nation   s most corrupt state, but officials argue that it doesn   t take into account its recent anti-corruption efforts.","seo":{"seo_title":"Mississippi, America's most corrupt state, defends itself","seo_description":"A recent study put Mississippi as the nation's most corrupt state, but officials argue that it doesn't take into account its recent anti-corruption efforts.","seo_keywords":"","seo_news_keywords":"mississippi, corruption, most corrupt states, united states, white collar crime, anti-corruption","seo_additional_meta":""},"social":{"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2014%2F07%2F28%2Fmost-corrupt-us-state-mississippi%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F1nZUhlY","encoded_title":"America%E2%80%99s+most+corrupt+state+defends%C2%A0itself","twitter_text":"America's most corrupt state defends\u00a0itself","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"A recent study put Mississippi as the nation's most corrupt state, but officials argue that it doesn't take into account its recent anti-corruption efforts.","facebook_title":"Mississippi, America's most corrupt state, defends itself"},"format":{"term_id":2710,"name":"Article","slug":"fortune-post-format-article","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"fortune_post_format","description":"","parent":0,"count":6144,"filter":"raw"},"related_posts":[]},{"id":781205,"url":"\/2014\/09\/14\/nintendo-wii-u-turnaround\/","title":"The game isn't over yet for Nintendo's Wii U","content":"<p>Can Mario, Donkey Kong and Yoshi swoop in and save the underperforming Wii U?<\/p>\n<p>The video game maker   s Wii U system has been on shelves for nearly two years. Hopes were high for the system, which was the successor to the popular Wii.<\/p>\n<p>But it hasn\u2019t sold as well as Nintendo initially expected. Through June 30 of this year, Wii U has <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/retail\/nintendo-wii-u\/\" target=\"_blank\">sold 6.68 million hardware units and nearly 37 million games<\/a>. Both of those totals are under what Nintendo had at one point projected it would sell in a single fiscal year.<\/p>\n<p>What   s been the problem? Analysts say  8220 software sells hardware, 8221  and Nintendo didn   t have enough games available during the Wii U   s first year on the market. Meanwhile, the Wii U has performed particularly poorly in North America and Western Europe, where more gamers are turning to the iPad and other tablets for their gaming fix, according to Lewis Ward, IDC\u2019s research director of gaming.<\/p>\n<p>Reggie Fils-Aime, president and chief operating officer of Nintendo   s North American division, said soon after the debut of the Wii U the company was  8220 dissatisfied 8221  with the pace of software developed at Nintendo.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 There were a number of games we wanted to launch early in the existence of Wii U that saw their launch times slip, some games by as much as six months, 8221  Fils-Aime said.<\/p>\n<p>The company has been playing catch up. There are eight more Nintendo-published games to be released in the final four months of 2014, bringing the number of games available on the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS up to nearly 70 games. Earlier this year,  8220 Mario Kart 8 8243  helped jolt sales, becoming just the second Wii U game to sell more than one million units in the U.S. Fils-Aime said Nintendo set a high bar for the newest Mario Kart, and sales have so far met those expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Through the first seven months of 2014, total sales of Wii U hardware and software jumped 60% and 135%, respectively, over the same period in 2013, according to NPD Group. The company is hopeful that a strong holiday lineup, as well as a slate of new offerings in 2015, will help accelerate interest in Wii U.<\/p>\n<p> 8220 We have a core fundamental belief at Nintendo and that is that innovative software is what drives consumers to experience our hardware, 8221  Fils-Aime said.<\/p>\n<p>If Nintendo were to continue to accelerate interest in the Wii U, it would represent a rare turnaround story. Hardware sales crest around three to four years after a system debuts, and generally only see another jolt in sales after a system   s price is cut.

TV stuck in the '70s?","content":"<p>It\u2019s been nearly 20 years since a Silicon Valley entrepreneur named Steve Perlman first sought to meld television and the Internet with a startup called WebTV. Yet the dream of an Internet television service where, like on the Web, every piece of content is available at all times, remains a work in progress.<\/p>\n<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook put it less charitably last week, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oBMo8Oz9jsQ&amp feature=youtu.be\">in an interview with Charlie Rose<\/a>: \u201cTV is one of those things that, if we are really honest, it\u2019s stuck in the    70s,\u201d Cook said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height=' 0' src='http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/oBMo8Oz9jsQ?version=3 038 rel=0 038 fs=1 038 showsearch=0 038 showinfo=1 038 iv_load_policy=1 038 wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Sure, there have been huge strides.

That\u2019s all leading to growing populations of cord-cutters\u2014people who cobble together a package of those services and unplug their cable lines\u2014and  8220 cord-nevers, 8221  millennials who have grown up watching video on the Web and never bothered to sign up for cable.<\/p>\n<p>But much of the hottest TV content remains locked up in the cable bundle, the large packet of channels sold by cable and satellite TV companies that include piles of programming that consumers never watch.<\/p>\n<p>And while cord-cutting is putting pressure on content providers to look at alternatives to the traditional, and lucrative, cable packages\u2014last week for instance, Viacom <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"VIA.B\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/via-b\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">VIA.B<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> agreed to let Sony <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"SNE\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/sne\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">SNE<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> carry channels like Nickelodeon and MTV for its planned Web television service\u2014the cable bundle has remained stubbornly intact so far.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNone of the new services look like a \u2018silver bullet\u2019 in the industry,\u201d says Ian Olgeirson, a senior analyst at SNL Kagan. \u201cNone is a killer package that is going to cause the collapse of the multichannel bundle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Devices are not the obstacle. The market has been flooded with gadgets that can deliver Internet video content. There\u2019s Apple TV, which has sold more than 20 units, according to Cook. There\u2019s also Amazon\u2019s Fire TV, Google\u2019s Chromecast, TiVo, Roku and scores of \u201csmart\u201d TVs. To broaden their appeal, several of these device makers have improved their interfaces, for instance, allowing users to browse several streaming services at once, rather than one by one.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s all pushed programmers, however slowly, to look for ways to make their most prized content more accessible. Last week, for instance, Time Warner <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"TWX\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/twx\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">TWX<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> CEO Jeff Bewkes told investors that a trial run that offered HBO, which owns some of the most prized television content anywhere, with cheaper cable packages was successful. And he seemed to suggest that the company would some day consider selling subscriptions to HBO Go separate from a cable package.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe reality is that cord cutting is happening whether or not these companies do anything or not,\u201d says Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. \u201cMulti-channel TV is in secular decline. It\u2019s not rapid. It\u2019s a slow melting. The question is what do you do to address it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, it\u2019s not just recalcitrant content owners that are holding back the dream of a Web-like TV world. It\u2019s also economics. Buying channels individually may not prove any cheaper for consumers\u2014not after they spend ever-larger sums for broadband service that is sold by the same companies brought them the cable bundle.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWould a $20 a month HBO Go make you leave your cable subscription?\u201d Olgeirson asks. \u201cIf you bought everything \u00e0 la carte, would you save money? It\u2019s not clear.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s challenges like these that have stopped Apple from jumping head first into the battle for the living room. Whether that will change is anyone\u2019s guess. When Rose asked Cook why Apple didn\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d TV, Cook replied: \u201cThis is an area that we continue to look at.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of comment that has kept pundits and fanboys speculating about an Apple television for years.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2014","published":"2014-09-15 07:05:34","updated":"2014-09-15 07:05:34","minute":"7:05 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/is-tv-stuck-in-the-70s\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/15\/is-tv-stuck-in-the-70s\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/apple-ceo-tim-cook-charlie-rose-september-2014.png?w=80&h=80&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_popular_articles","credit":"Courtesy: PBS\/Charlie Rose LLC","caption":"Apple CEO Tim Cook speaking to Charlie Rose in September 2014.","attach_id":"787579"},"short_title":"Is TV stuck in the '70s?","excerpt":"<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook thinks so.

As the world\u2019s population tops 7 billion, and soon 8 and 9, it\u2019s becoming clear that the best performing organizations, and perhaps countries, will be less defined by absolute size and more defined by the speed and agility that comes from clarity of purpose, strategic insight and decisive action. As the scale of human organizing expands to unprecedented levels, the winners will be those people, organizations, and countries that can: focus on what matters most to their core stakeholders  rapidly process new information, learn from it, and then thoughtfully and deliberately act amid the complexity.<\/p>\n<p>Think Airbnb. They\u2019ve experienced explosive growth \u2013 and not by the traditional means of buying or building more properties. They did it by understanding what really mattered to those booking hotel rooms. They did it by studying the emergence of the \u201csharing economy.\u201d And, absent a vast footprint of physical assets, they did it by acting decisively to create a whole new model for meeting this traditional need \u2013 a model that delivers competitive advantage through scale but not in a traditional sense of physically controlled properties. Indeed, Airbnb not only created a new model, it created a new market.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s global marketplace that operates 24\/7, the traditional barriers to entry are falling, and traditional conceptualizations of growth as increasing in size and span of control are losing their potency. Market and customer access have become easier  product and idea life cycles are shrinking as ideas, data, and knowledge travel fast and openly across the Internet. Competitive advantage gained from expensive product innovations is shorter-lived. And brands are losing their stickiness amid an onslaught of data, ideas and emotional triggers that compete for human attention, loyalty and spending.<\/p>\n<p>In light of these changes, it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019re seeing new approaches to driving growth throughout the Fortune 500. One example is the recent spate of mammoth splits at traditional powerhouse firms including Motorola <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSI\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/msi\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSI<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Kraft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"KRFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/krft\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">KRFT<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and Abbott. In each case, powerful CEOs chose to divide the size of their companies (and spans of control) in half in order to increase focus and speed growth. For the same reasons, portfolio rationalizations are now commonplace  e.g., <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/08\/07\/why-pg-can-grow-by-shrinking\/\">Procter &amp  Gamble<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"PG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/pg\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">PG<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, ITW and Unilever <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"UN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/un\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">UN<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>. And even more recently, expensive inversions have become in vogue, including firms like Eaton and Abbvie.<\/p>\n<p>CEOs of traditional mega-conglomerates are literally slicing up and uprooting their organizations in order to fuel growth. And they have to because the successes of companies like Airbnb and Uber have shown that smaller firms with simpler and more nimble infrastructures can win  8211  just look at the market caps being attached to these asset-lite firms.

According to the lawsuit, Quaker Oats took control of  8220 64 of [Harrington's] recipes and 22 complete menus 8221  and marketed them to the public.<\/p>\n<p>Filed last week by Harrington   s great-grandson, D.W. Hunter, who is representing himself, the lawsuit alleges that Chicago-based Quaker Oats hired Harrington to take over the pre-existing Aunt Jemima role in 1935\u2014a role she continued to serve when the company first registered the brand   s trademark two years later\u2014and that the company also reproduced Harrington   s own pancake recipe on a mass scale. The suit claims that Harrington had entered into a  8220 written contractual agreement to play the actress role of Aunt Jemima 8221  that entitled her to royalties, including a percentage of the proceeds, accumulated by the brand over the years.<\/p>\n<p>Hunter   s lawsuit accuses the companies of lying to cover up Quaker Oats    employment of Harrington, adding that the heirs determined they were owed royalties when they say they discovered last October that the company had trademarked the image of their great-grandmother with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 1937 and after they found a death certificate for Harrington that named the company as her employer. Hunter has accused the companies of breach of contract, conspiracy, and fraud, among other charges, while alleging that Quaker Oats engaged in  8220 industrial espionage 8221  to procure Harrington   s trade secrets before failing to compensate her estate on an annual basis following her death.<\/p>\n<p>The lawsuit estimates that Pinnacle has sold roughly $300 million worth of frozen pancakes, waffles, and other products from the Aunt Jemima line without providing Harrington   s family with any royalties.

The company that in the early 1970s  8220 began as a quasi-communal hippie farm, 8221  Pollan wrote, had, in the words of its erstwhile-hippie founder Gene Kahn, morphed into a  8220 PR farm 8221  for General Mills after that company acquired it in 2000. Kahn joined General Mills as a vice president, and he enthusiastically signed on to that company   s far-more-corporate approach to organic food.<\/p>\n<p>Ever since, critics of the food industry have cited Cascadian Farm as an outfit that adheres to the letter of the law without necessarily adhering to the spirit of the organic-food movement. Similar complaints are already being issued in regard to General Mills    <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/08\/general-mills-expaning-organics-natural-foods-annies\/\">announcement<\/a> on Monday that it will acquire Annie   s Inc. <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"BNNY\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/bnny\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">BNNY<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, a Berkeley, Calif., company that <em>The New York Times<\/em> <a href=\"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2014\/09\/08\/general-mills-to-buy-annies-for-820-million-in-cash\/\">noted<\/a> is known for its  8220 earthy vibe. 8221 <\/p>\n<p>The question for critics is whether General Mills cares more about Annie   s vibe than it does about its fealty to organic principles. In an email to <em>Fortune<\/em>, Pollan said he   s not familiar with the details of the Annie   s acquisition, but added that  8220 the parallels with Cascadian Farm would seem to be relevant. Is General Mills committed to the ideals of Annie   s, or just the brand? 8221 <\/p>\n<p>For investors, it probably doesn   t matter. General Mills    cash offer of $820 million (or $46 a share) is a 37% premium over Monday   s closing price. That   s still considerably lower than the $51.36 Annie   s shares reached in October.<\/p>\n<p>The acquisition is meant to help General Mills make up for <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/06\/25\/general-mills-earnings-down\/\">flagging cereal sales<\/a>. The company notes that the  8220 organic and natural 8221  category is growing at about a 12% annual clip industrywide. General Mills    Small Planet Foods division, which markets Cascadian Farm, Muir Glen, and other labels, reported revenue of about $330 million last year. Annie   s annual sales are at about $200 million a year.<\/p>\n<p>The near-absence of organic crunchiness was noticeable in General Mills    announcement of the acquisition. The closest it got was in a statement from Jeff Harmening, General Mills    executive vice president and chief operating officer, who alluded to Annie   s  8220 purpose-driven culture and authentic brand. 8221  Otherwise, he was all business:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Annie   s competes in a number of attractive food categories, with particular strength in convenient meals and snacks\u2014two of General Mills    priority platforms. \u2026 We believe that combining the Annie   s product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities with General Mills    supply chain, sales and marketing resources will accelerate the growth of our organic and natural foods business.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, Annie   s CEO John Foraker <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/annieshomegrown\/posts\/10152358423211334\">took to Facebook<\/a> to try to reassure customers with a statement that was impassioned, but vague:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I want you all to know that our mission, culture, and values and the things we stand for will remain the same. We   ll continue to make the same great products, more of them actually, using ingredients we are proud of, business practices that are respectful of the environment, and that make our planet a better place. We   ve spent 25 years building trust with consumers, one interaction at a time. We will continue to do that. Count on it. I always ask people to listen to what we say, but more importantly, watch what we do! We will not let you down! Our mission: We cultivate a healthier, happier world by spreading goodness through nourishing foods, honest words and conduct that is considerate and forever kind to the planet. that mission is hard won and has been built with integrity. We will never abandon it, but rather we will further it, by putting our product into millions of new homes, which will expand our positive impact even more. I have given 15 years of my life to that mission and I am not stopping now.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A commenter on Foraker   s post noted General Mills    opposition to a defeated California ballot measure, Prop. 37, in 2012 that would have required food products containing genetically modified ingredients to be so labeled. General Mills donated more than $1 million to defeat the measure.  8220 I will not give money to a company that is against what Annie   s stood for, 8221  she wrote. Her comment received 737 likes, and other erstwhile Annie   s fans piled on with similar comments.<\/p>\n<p>The passionate objections to the merger reveal how successful Annie   s has been in maintaining its reputation of being  8220 homespun and healthful, 8221  as <em>The New York Times<\/em> put it, despite facts that would tend to counter that image.<\/p>\n<p>Launched in 1989 by Annie Withey, who initially sold the company   s flagship macaroni-and-cheese brand in grocery stores in the northeast, Annie   s was acquired by the private equity firm Solera Capital in 2002. It went public in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Although much of the coverage of the General Mills acquisition has identified Annie   s as an  8220 organic 8221  producer, that   s only partly true. Many of its products are not certified organic. In 2007, all of Annie   s products bore an  8220 organic 8221  label. Now, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pressherald.com\/2011\/11\/16\/for-cereal-natural-may-not-be-as-natural-as-you-think_2011-11-16\/\">only about one-fifth of them do<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Annie   s, then, isn   t any crunchier than General Mills    existing organic lines, but since Annie   s still has that  8220 vibe, 8221  the question is whether it will help General Mills in the long run. The food giant  8220 risks smothering its latest acquisition target, 8221  <a href=\"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2014\/09\/09\/the-risk-in-the-general-mills-deal-for-annies\/\">concluded<\/a> Kevin Allison of Reuters    Breakingviews. While the companies have made assurances that Annie   s will be left to operate independently  8212  maintaining its Berkeley headquarters and retaining Foraker to run the business  8212  while still being able to tap into General Mills    marketing and distribution infrastructure, General Mills  8220 may be left relying on elusive revenue synergies to make the acquisition play, 8221  Allison wrote.<\/p>\n<p>If that happens, it will save costs, but it could dilute the brand.<\/p>\n<p>That   s the risk for any big food company that tries to have it both ways. The  8220 organic and natural 8221  category is burgeoning, while many mainstream categories  8212  like breakfast cereals  8212  have slowed or stopped growing altogether. But for many consumers, a big part of the appeal (perceived or real) of organic and natural brands is the independence (perceived or real) of the producer. Big food companies that acquire such producers must walk a fine line to maintain that image while extracting the maximum value from it.<\/p>\n<p>They have had mixed success, and the successes have often resulted from allowing acquired companies to go it alone to the extent possible. For instance, while a lot of people know that Ben &amp  Jerry   s is owned by the giant Unilever <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"UN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/un\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">UN<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, the brand is still largely thought of as independent, because in many ways, it is. Ben &amp  Jerry   s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/articles\/2014-07-31\/gmo-labeling-ben-and-jerrys-parent-company-unilever-at-odds\">takes the opposite side<\/a> from Unilever on a host of issues, including GMOs.<\/p>\n<p>Its marketing is separate and distinct from that of other Unilever brands. Some  8220 synergies 8221  might be lost, but the long run success of Ben &amp  Jerry   s, which Unilever acquired in 2000, has depended on the brand   s distinctive image.<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, in 2000 (which turns out to have been a big year for such deals) Kellogg <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"K\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/k\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">K<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> acquired Kashi, the once-beloved company best known for its natural cereals, and, over time, managed the brand to disaster.<\/p>\n<p>In 2012 it was <a href=\"http:\/\/usatoday30.usatoday.com\/money\/industries\/food\/story\/2012-04-29\/kashi-natural-claims\/54616576\/1\">discovered<\/a> that Kashi cereals contained GMOs. This went viral on social media. The company only made matters worse by noting the plain fact that the federal government does not regulate the word  8220 natural 8221  on food labels. That same year, another uproar ensued due to Kellogg   s donations to the  8220 No on Prop. 37 8243  campaign. In 2013, Kellogg moved Kashi from its longtime home in La Jolla, Calif., to Kellogg headquarter in Battle Creek, Mich.  8212  but it has already decided to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bakingbusiness.com\/articles\/news_home\/Financial-Performance\/2014\/08\/Kellogg_installs_new_leadershi.aspx?ID=%7BC6ABCEA3-7930-49BD-ADCE-47E1C7559A %7D&amp e=casey@littlerooster.net&amp cck=1\">reverse<\/a> that move in its effort to restore the brand   s image.<\/p>\n<p>General Mills has certainly done well with its organic and natural lines, which it runs in a separate division called Small Planet Foods. Its Nature Valley granola bars might the opposite of healthy (12 grams of sugar per serving), and even the <a href=\"http:\/\/brucebradley.com\/food\/nature-valley-or-a-slippery-slope\/\">opposite<\/a> of  8220 natural, 8221  but their  8220 wholesome 8221  image is what sells them (and the sweetness is what keeps people coming back for more, whether or not they happen to look at the nutrition information.)

It\u2019s a vote that could rip apart Europe\u2019s third-biggest economy and jolt nations across the region. Much as in Wallace\u2019s time, the issue pits the dreamers against the doomsayers (minus the bloodshed) and threatens to end an alliance that has lasted for centuries. \u201cScotland has been a nation for a very long time,\u201d says Duncan Ross, a professor of economic history at the University of Glasgow. \u201cWe should have the right to decide how to rule ourselves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps so. Yet for Europe the question is, At what price? The intense nervousness over how the Scots might vote extends far beyond the territory\u2019s rugged mountains. Many in Europe fear that Scotland\u2019s independence fervor could ripple across the continent, where a number of separatist campaigns have simmered for years. The hotspots range from the mountainous Basque region at the border of Spain and France to the Mediterranean island of Corsica to the lowlands of Belgium, where many in the Flemish majority want to say <em>tot ziens<\/em> to their French-speaking countrymen. Some of these movements have a history of violence  several more seem merely rhetorical\u2014and, well, quixotic (independent Venice?). But taken together, the sovereignty pushes are yet another reminder of how tenuous the notion of one cohesive \u201cEuropean Union\u201d truly is (see graphic below).<\/p>\n<p style=\"width:475px line-height:1.25em text-align:center border:8px color:white background-color:black padding:7px \"><span style=\"font-size:24px font-weight:bold \">Scots who favor splitting off from Britain \u201care fighting for something they believe in,\u201d says one professor. \u201cThere is an asymmetry of passion.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The sense of Europe splintering at the edges has deepened with the soaring popularity of anti-EU parties like France\u2019s National Front and Britain\u2019s Independence Party, which want their countries out of the Union. And even if Scotland\u2019s independence vote fails, Britain could be forced to offer Scots far greater autonomy, including perhaps more control over their budget\u2014something that could further complicate the EU\u2019s already plodding economic policymaking. With each new voice at the table, says Steven Blockmans of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, \u201cit becomes more and more difficult to align everyone\u2019s interests.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed in 2012 to a Scottish referendum on independence, the odds seemed remote that voters would choose to split from Britain after 300 years of albeit awkward union, abandoning the U.K.\u2019s modern military and its permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Yet as the vote has drawn nearer, Scots increasingly seem eager for far-reaching change, with recent polls putting the ditch-Britain vote at 40%. \u201cPeople on the yes [for independence] side are fighting for something they believe in passionately, while on the no side, the feeling is, \u2018Why change countries?\u2019\u201d says John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University. \u201cThere is an asymmetry of passion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/mac01_1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-769808\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/mac01_1.jpg?w=750 038 h=500\" alt=\"Television Debate Between Alex Salmond And Alistair Darling\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">GLASGOW, SCOTLAND  8211  AUGUST 05: (L-R) Alex Salmond First Minister of Scotland and Alistair Darling chairman of Better Together take part in a live television debate from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland on August 5, 2014 in Glasgow, Scotland.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Jeff J Mitchell Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Those in favor of independence say that Scotland should commit a portion of its North Sea oil earnings to funding public health, pensions, and education\u2014as oil-rich Norway does\u2014rather than let British lawmakers divvy it up. Supporters also say they\u2019d evict the Trident nuclear submarines stationed on the Clyde River should there be a split. Sure, a new Scotland would be small. But it would still dwarf several other EU countries, including Malta, Cyprus, and wealthy Luxembourg (pop. 530,000). \u201cThis notion that you have to be part of a big country is just not true in the EU,\u201d Ross says. \u201cSome of the most successful EU countries are small, like Denmark. And if some of our decisions turn out not to be right, we\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Whatever the outcome of Scotland\u2019s vote, few places will feel its impact as strongly as Spain\u2019s autonomous Catalonia region 1,000 miles away. With 7.5 million Catalans speaking their own language and running a large economy in northeastern Spain, the separatist politicians in Barcelona command huge support. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has vowed to block Catalan plans for a Nov. 11 independence referendum and to ignore the results.<\/p>\n<p>So far, Rajoy\u2019s tough talk has helped stoke separatist feelings in Barcelona, with pro-independence parties arguing that recession-hit Spain sucks away Catalan resources. \u201cCatalonia suffers fiscal drainage of \u20ac8 billion to \u20ac11 billion a year, if not more, from Spain,\u201d says Manuel Manonelles, director general for European and Multilateral Affairs in Catalonia\u2019s government. Like other Catalans, Manonelles sees answers to their political frustrations in one far-off place: Scotland. \u201cThe British people are giving a good example of democratic spirit\u201d in allowing Scotland\u2019s vote, he says. \u201cWe\u2019re watching the referendum closely.\u201d So, too, is the rest of Europe.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-full\"><img src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/disunited-euro-list.jpg\" alt=\"disunited-euro-list\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Graphic by: POP Chart Lab\/Analee Kasudia\u2014Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><em>Reporting by: Preetisha Sen and Robert Hackett<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>This story is from the September 1, 2014 issue of Fortune.<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"August 14, 2014","published":"2014-08-14 07:14:15","updated":"2014-08-14 07:14:15","minute":"7:14 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/08\/14\/europe-separatism\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/08\/14\/europe-separatism\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/disunited-euro-map1.jpg?w=820&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_feature_slideshow","credit":"","caption":"","attach_id":775313},"short_title":"The Disunited States of Europe","excerpt":"Scottish voters decide this month whether to split from Britain.

Its title will help explain: \u201cDon\u2019t send your kids to the Ivy League: The nation\u2019s top colleges are turning our kids into zombies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the article, which was published by <em>The New Republic<\/em> this summer, Deresiewicz characterized Ivy League students as competitive hoop jumpers who\u2014as adolescents\u2014had been so programmed to try to meet the sky-high requirements of top-tier institutions that once they were admitted and arrived, they simply sought out the next hurdles to clear. They gave more thought to padding their resumes than choosing their coursework and wound up on a conveyor belt into careers on Wall Street or in consultancy.<\/p>\n<p>In his recently published book <em>Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and The Way to a Meaningful Life<\/em>, Deresiewicz argues that colleges should be institutions that teach students <em>how<\/em> to learn through a variety of courses. Instead, the elite education system \u201cmanufactures young people who are smart and talented and driven, yes, but also anxious, timid, and lost, with little intellectual curiosity and a stunted sense of purpose: trapped in a bubble of privilege, heading meekly in the same direction, great at what they\u2019re doing but with no idea why they\u2019re doing it, 8221  he wrote in <em>The New Republic<\/em> article.<\/p>\n<p>That certainly ticked a lot of people off, including Harvard professor Steven Pinker who, in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newrepublic.com\/article\/119321\/harvard-ivy-league-should-judge-students-standardized-tests\" target=\"_blank\">a rebuttal<\/a> published last week, said Deresiewicz   s arguments are \u201clong on dogmatic assertion\u201d and \u201cshort on objective analysis.\u201d It was, Pinker wrote, \u201cdriven by a literarism which exalts bohemian authenticity over worldly success and analytical brainpower.\u201d Pinker\u2019s solution to what he acknowledges is a \u201cwasteful and unjust\u201d education system: admit students based on their standardized test scores.<\/p>\n<p>Lost in this stuffy disagreement between two academics from Ivy League schools over whether the country\u2019s elite are getting a good enough education is any mention of the higher ed hot topic of the day\u2014student debt. You know, that nagging load of money\u2014$1 trillion-plus\u2014that\u2019s trailing today\u2019s young adults when they leave college.<\/p>\n<p>So, how does Deresiewicz   s suggested focus on the humanities and  8220 learning how to learn 8221  agree with today\u2019s competitive job market and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/numbers\/congatulations-to-class-of-2014-the-most-indebted-ever-1368\/\" target=\"_blank\">the $33,000 in debt<\/a> that hits the average student on graduation day?<\/p>\n<p><em>Fortune<\/em> went straight to the source. Here\u2019s what Deresiewicz had to say about how his outlook fits into today\u2019s economy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fortune: First off, what exactly do you mean when you say students should learn how to learn in college? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>William Deresiewicz: Schools say that they teach you to think analytically  to puzzle through what are essentially technical problems, whether it\u2019s an actual technical field or social science or the humanities. I\u2019m talking about something more than that  I\u2019m talking about an ability to think critically about fundamental assumptions about society at large. So recognizing and critically thinking about all the things you learned to believe without even knowing that you were learning to believe them: things your parents taught you, things society taught you and, most relevantly, those assumptions in so far as what they have to do with how you conduct your own life. So most obviously\u2014what should your goals in life be  what should you be living for?<\/p>\n<p><strong>You spend a lot of time hating on colleges as they exist now. Is there another way to learn to learn? What about ideas like the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/peter-thiels-contrarian-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Thiel fellowship<\/a> that gives promising entrepreneurs $100,000 to drop out of school?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thiel\u2019s solution is not a solution beyond the 24 kids who win his scholarship. If you\u2019re an average person and don\u2019t go to college, you\u2019re putting yourself in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/05\/27\/upshot\/is-college-worth-it-clearly-new-data-say.html?abt=0002&amp abg=1\" target=\"_blank\">an enormous practical disadvantage<\/a>. Maybe that won\u2019t be true in 20 years, but it\u2019s certainly true now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A big reason why that\u2019s true, of course, is because college degrees, especially those from elite schools, carry so much weight in the job market. Is that ever going to change?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, in terms of future earnings, it doesn\u2019t matter where you go to school. <a href=\"http:\/\/economix.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/02\/21\/revisiting-the-value-of-elite-colleges\/\" target=\"_blank\">A study released a few years ago found<\/a> that if you looks at someone who went to Princeton, someone who got into Princeton but didn\u2019t go, and even someone who just applied to Princeton, they end up making the same amount of money because what matters is the kid, not the school. I just wish more people knew that. Still, there\u2019s no question that in terms of prestige and access, going to the best school matters. My grand solution is to rebuild public higher education.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You\u2019ve said that in your perfect world, higher ed would consist of free or low-cost colleges. Why is that the solution?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think that might solve all the problems I\u2019ve talked about. It solves the problem of student debt. It solves the problem of kids feeling that they have to study a lucrative field\u2014it goes a long way to addressing this rush to practicality. If you reduce the financial burden, people have the freedom to study something more interesting.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Okay. Until that happens, students are going to have debt and need to make a decent living to pay it off. Can they do that and still abide by your humanities-heavy advice?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t see the connection that everyone sees\u2014that by devoting part of your college experience to these larger issues of getting a real education that you are somehow disadvantaging yourself on the job market. I don\u2019t see that as a valid connection for a number of reasons. A\u2014I\u2019m not saying you have to major in English. We have a system that enables you to study more than one thing. In fact, that\u2019s the purpose of the system, and we\u2019re the only country like that. There\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t study computer science and the other stuff. B\u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/atwork\/2013\/04\/10\/your-college-major-is-a-minor-issue-employers-say\/%20\" target=\"_blank\">there\u2019s been a lot of studies<\/a> about how much employers value liberal arts skills  they value technical skills, but they also value liberal art skills. C\u2014studying a variety of subjects is a very practical thing  it helps you figure out what you want to do with your life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>At the end of the day, why does all this matter? What\u2019s the risk if the \u201cmiseducation of the American elite\u201d\u2014as you call it\u2014persists?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2014and many other people\u2014have witnessed a complete failure of our elites for the last 10, or even 15 to 20 years. They all seem to be the same\u2014self-serving, self-enclosed, not creative or innovative. In my book I give the example of ex-BP CEO Tony Hayward (even though he\u2019s British) and his \u201cI want my life back\u201d comment. There\u2019s no larger sense that this is about more than their careers. They\u2019re not putting their country ahead of themselves. The implicit criticism of my book is that this is a societal problem, not a college problem. Yes, but colleges are part of what shape our culture and they help determine who rises to the top. They used to be counter-culture  they preserved non-material values. They had missions other than simply being what society wanted them to be.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 10, 2014","published":"2014-09-10 01:59:57","updated":"2014-09-10 01:59:57","minute":"1:59 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/10\/college-education-worth-debt\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/10\/college-education-worth-debt\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/169664633.jpg?w=820&h=570&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_feature_slideshow","credit":"Paul Marotta\u2014Getty Images","caption":"Commencement at Harvard University in 2013.","attach_id":784602},"short_title":"American elite colleges: In a state of 'complete failure'?","excerpt":"Ex-Yale professor William Deresiewicz has sounded the alarm on the U.S. elite education system.","authors":[{"id":"381338","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/claire-zillman\/","name":"Claire Zillman","twitter":"clairezillman","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"55\" height=\"55\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/claire-zillman-759.jpg?w=55\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"FORTUNE MAGAZINE DITORS HEADSHOTS - PHOTO EDITOR NEIL HARRIS\" \/>","bio":"","title":"","company":""}],"sections":[{"term_id":4236,"name":"Management","slug":"management","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46727,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and advice on management, leadership, jobs, careers, CEOs and anyone who aspires to the C-suite.","parent":0,"count":6099,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Management","slug":"management","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/category\/management\/"},"tags":[{"term_id":46984,"name":"colleges","slug":"colleges","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":106696,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":2,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":1342,"name":"Education","slug":"education","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":109746,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":30,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":243103134,"name":"Excellent Sheep","slug":"excellent-sheep","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":115816,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":5897,"name":"Higher education","slug":"higher-education","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":52591,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":115,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":264,"name":"Learning","slug":"learning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":115815,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":455293,"name":"student debt","slug":"student-debt","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":110852,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":5833199,"name":"William Deresiewicz","slug":"william-deresiewicz","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":115817,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"}],"primary_tag":{"name":"Higher education","slug":"higher-education","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/higher-education\/"},"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"Ex-Yale professor William Deresiewicz has sounded the alarm on the U.S. elite education system.","seo":{"seo_title":"American elite colleges: In a state of 'complete failure'?","seo_description":"Ex-Yale professor William Deresiewicz has sounded the alarm on the U.S. elite education system.","seo_keywords":"","seo_news_keywords":"colleges, universities, yale, harvard, education, higher education, student debt, William Deresiewicz, Excellent Sheep","seo_additional_meta":""},"social":{"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2014%2F09%2F10%2Fcollege-education-worth-debt%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F1AyIi65","encoded_title":"American+elite+colleges%3A+In+a+state+of+%E2%80%98complete%C2%A0failure%E2%80%99%3F","twitter_text":"American elite colleges: In a state of 'complete\u00a0failure'?","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"Ex-Yale professor William Deresiewicz has sounded the alarm on the U.S. elite education system.","facebook_title":"American elite colleges: In a state of 'complete failure'?"},"format":{"term_id":2710,"name":"Article","slug":"fortune-post-format-article","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"fortune_post_format","description":"","parent":0,"count":6158,"filter":"raw"},"related_posts":[]},{"id":784620,"url":"\/2014\/09\/10\/alibabas-ipo-a-wall-street-fable\/","title":"The Wall Street fable behind Alibaba's IPO","content":"<p>A friend who\u2019s a major money manager\u2014call him Oscar\u2014recently related a story about just how intoxicating a big-pop IPO can be. On a flight from LA to New York a few years ago, Oscar was seated across the aisle from the CFO of a California company that had just gone public. \u201cIt was fantastic!\u201d crowed the executive, his volume rising as he downed one gin and tonic after another. \u201cOur stock jumped 30% the first day! That\u2019s tens of millions of dollars!\u201d As they deplaned, Oscar remarked to the stumbling CFO, \u201cWouldn\u2019t your company be worth a lot more if you\u2019d put those tens of millions in your treasury, instead of giving that money away?\u201d The CFO suddenly turned reflective, as if he\u2019d never heard of that idea\u2014though it\u2019s unlikely the facts stopped his binge of self-congratulation for long.<\/p>\n<p>It now appears that BIG POP is working its intoxicating spell on Alibaba\u2014soon to trade under the ticker <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"BABA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/baba\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">BABA<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>. The road show for its forthcoming IPO is now in full swing, and its shares are reportedly proving a huge hit with institutional investors. Big fund managers, anticipating an overnight windfall, are reportedly requesting far more shares for their portfolios than Alibaba is selling at a price somewhere between $60 and $66 a share\u2014the exact number will be determined on September 18, on the eve of its eagerly awaited debut.<\/p>\n<p>What appears to be growing excess demand for Alibaba stock is likely to cause what it always causes: a steep rise in the share price in the first days of trading. That pop is one of Wall Street\u2019s prized events. The term evokes images of exploding champagne corks, a sign of flush times in the markets\u2014and if you believe what Wall Street is selling, the hallmark of a successful IPO.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, a big first-day pop means that the underwriters have sold the shares too cheaply, at far below the price those institutional buyers were really willing to pay. The major beneficiaries are the famous Wall Street names and their commission-paying clients  the loser is the company that raises far less cash than if its shares had sold at market prices. What\u2019s remarkable is that so many great companies <em>voluntarily<\/em> leave so many billions \u201con the table.\u201d And it\u2019s amazing how many supposedly sophisticated entrepreneurs are conned by the prospect. Especially since Wall Street has only the weakest rationale for selling it: Pin-striped bankers promise that those first-day price surges will make for great \u201cpublicity\u201d for the newbie companies, and attract a coterie of loyal investors.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, the only coterie it\u2019s likely to attract is the crowd of celebrating bankers that night at Peter Luger\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>Successful newly public companies don\u2019t always start with a pop. Facebook\u2019s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"FB\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/fb\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">FB<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> shares famously dropped in early trading, meaning it raised more cash than it deserved at its 2012 debut. And it\u2019s not certain that Alibaba\u2019s shares will pop at all, once all is said and done. But to hear the hype surrounding what is likely to be the biggest IPO in tech history, it sure likes like Wall Streeters expect it to. Should that be the case, the amount of money Alibaba could forgo\u2014and the size of the prize for Wall Street\u2014are unprecedented.<\/p>\n<p>To understand the jubilation among the fraternity of capital-markets types, let\u2019s examine Alibaba\u2019s plan, as revealed in its prospectus released on Sept. 5. The Chinese online and mobile commerce colossus is offering a maximum of 368 million shares for sale through six principal underwriters: Credit Suisse <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"CS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/cs\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">CS<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Morgan Stanley <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/ms\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MS<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, JPMorgan Chase <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"JPM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/jpm\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">JPM<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Goldman Sachs <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/gs\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GS<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Citigroup <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"C\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/c\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">C<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, and Deutsche Bank <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"DB\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/db\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">DB<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>. If the shares sell at the top of the pricing range, at $66, the IPO would raise more than $24 billion, putting Alibaba\u2019s market cap at $163 billion.<\/p>\n<p>So what happens if the company\u2019s shares pop 25% on Day One? They would then close at $82.50, handing the institutions that purchased them through the underwriters a gain of $16.50 a share. If Alibaba and insiders had gotten that <em>real<\/em> market price instead of $66, they would have collected an additional $6 billion. That\u2019s right: $6 billion. As far as tips go, that\u2019s a staggering sum. (Any waiter at Peter Luger would be thrilled to get it.) But a tip is what it is\u2014because that\u2019s what\u2019s being left on the table.<\/p>\n<p>The losers would divide into two categories. Large shareholders including Yahoo! and founder Jack Ma are selling as many as 219 million shares, so their portion of the foregone cash comes to about $3.6 billion. The company itself is selling the balance of the shares. Hence, it\u2019s leaving around $2.4 billion on the table. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that the same company with $2.4 billion more in cash is worth $2.4 billion more than the same company <em>sans <\/em>that cash. It\u2019s therefore likely that Alibaba would sacrifice about 1.5% of its potential market value by allowing its shares to be 25% underpriced.<\/p>\n<p>So who are the major winners? No surprise here: the Wall Street firms and their high-roller clients who get to buy the underpriced shares. It\u2019s not in banking fees where the big money resides. \u201cThe underwriters wanted higher fees but Chinese companies and those outside the U.S. pay less for a given sized deal,\u201d says Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida. \u201cThis is also a high-profile deal that put Alibaba in a strong bargaining position.\u201d The investment banks are garnering around $350 million in fees, or only around 1% of the proceeds, well below the norm on most IPOs.<\/p>\n<p>No the cash payout to the bankers travels in a more circuitous route. These fabled Wall Street firms are handing their favorite clients $6 billion in quick profits. That\u2019s around 10% of the total amount left on the table in the entire tech boom from 1999 to 2001. Investors, in turn, are very likely to repay the firms with big trading commissions in the days and weeks to come. The biggest such payers tend to be hedge funds, so hedge funds usually get the meatiest share allocations. Mutual funds that pay low commissions have less favored status.<\/p>\n<p>The rule of thumb, says Ritter, is that Wall Street recoups 30% of the total windfall in commissions. That\u2019s $1.8 billion. So including fees, Wall Street\u2019s potential take mounts to well over $2.1 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we don\u2019t know if Alibaba will pop at all\u2014or if so, by how much. But this is one of the great spectacles in the financial world. Wall Street is trying to work its intoxicating magic once again, and they\u2019ve got folks who should know a lot better believing a tale no more believable than the <em>Arabian Nights<\/em>: the fables that brought us the first Alibaba.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 10, 2014","published":"2014-09-10 03:10:58","updated":"2014-09-10 03:10:58","minute":"3:10 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/10\/alibabas-ipo-a-wall-street-fable\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/10\/alibabas-ipo-a-wall-street-fable\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/488515351.jpg?w=820&h=570&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_feature_slideshow","credit":"Tomohiro Ohsumi\/Bloomberg\u2014Getty Images","caption":"Jack Ma, chairman and former CEO of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., speaks during a news conference in Tokyo","attach_id":784619},"short_title":"The Wall Street fable behind Alibaba's IPO","excerpt":"Talk of the company's shares \"popping\" on the first day is all about enriching Wall Street.

Historically, the U.S. has been able to rely on Arab nations to meet about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eia.gov\/tools\/faqs\/faq.cfm?id=727&amp t=6\">30%<\/a> of its oil needs, but the explosive political landscape in the Middle East could restrict or even shut down that supply at any time.<\/p>\n<p>While the erstwhile popular theory of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/has-peak-oil-already-happened\/\">\u2018peak oil\u2019<\/a>, which postulates that domestic supplies of U.S. oil reached their peak in 2005 and will falter in the future has been widely <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/davidblackmon\/2013\/07\/16\/as-fracking-rises-peak-oil-theory-slowly-dies\/\">discredited<\/a>, it still contains some truth. Even if oil production is not declining, energy consumption is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bp.com\/en\/global\/corporate\/about-bp\/energy-economics\/statistical-review-of-world-energy\/2013-in-review\/oil.html\">rising rapidly,<\/a> which is the other side of the coin. At the same time, environmental regulations that restrict the ability of oil companies to drill in protected areas like the Arctic Natural Wildlife Refuge puts pressure on new drilling, and can still lead to an energy shortfall.<\/p>\n<p>On the back of this situation, natural gas has risen in importance. It provides a seemingly endless supply of energy for everything from heating to electricity. Currently, natural gas accounts for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eia.gov\/forecasts\/aeo\/er\/early_fuel.cfm\">27% of electricity generation<\/a> stateside, driven by low natural gas prices, and is projected to rise to 30% by 2040. Despite political controversy over \u2018fracking,\u2019 a technique used to extract shale gas from the ground, there is little reason to believe that the U.S. can practically afford to impose limits in this arena given the immense value of this resource for our energy infrastructure. In addition, the U.S. currently has 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which is enough to last for 92 years, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eia.gov\/tools\/faqs\/faq.cfm?id=58&amp t=8\">U.S. Energy Information Administration<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>However, these statistics are based on demand remaining static at today\u2019s levels. They fail to factor in the possibility of an oil supply deficit in the future, either due to government regulations that restrict new drilling or perhaps a shock in the Middle East, which would automatically lead to the faster consumption of natural gas and cause a supply\/demand imbalance in that sector as well.<\/p>\n<p>This means that other sources of energy will be required to supplement natural gas for the U.S. to achieve energy independence.<\/p>\n<p>One possibility is biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, which are obtained from plant tissues and are renewable. However, these fuels generate much less energy than crude oil and are difficult to refine. Researchers are working on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/Environment\/Energy-Voices\/2014\/0723\/New-biofuels-match-crude-oil-s-energy-but-there-s-a-catch\">methods to counter these factors<\/a> but are still very early in that process. Biofuels are also, contrary to popular notion, <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/news\/articles\/SB1000142405274870357460457450001 27534676\">not carbon neutral<\/a>. The other options are traditional sources such as coal and nuclear, which will continue to provide a steady percentage of our energy needs. However, the environmental concerns surrounding these fuels, as with biofuels, could <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eia.gov\/forecasts\/aeo\/er\/early_production.cfm\">hamper production<\/a> and provide an impetus for the generation of clean energy, driven by solar, hydroelectric, wind, geothermal, and hydrogen fuel cell technologies.<\/p>\n<p>This is supported by a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2014-08-26\/irreversible-damage-seen-from-climate-change-in-un-leak.html\">new report<\/a> by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which echoes alarms about global warming and highlights the need for the U.S. to seriously examine its progress on energy.<\/p>\n<p>Today, clean energy accounts for only 8% of electricity generation and 11% of total energy production in the U.S. The reason for this is the high expense of producing clean energy relative to the output, and consequently pricing. In addition, investment in low carbon technologies fails to yield sufficient savings to make it cost effective for the power sector and industrial consumers, leading to a slower migration to energy efficient technologies. Making this scenario even more complicated are the mixed signals from policymakers over the years on carbon pricing, which underpins the economics in this arena.<\/p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iea.org\/publications\/freepublications\/publication\/WEIO2014.pdf\">can all change<\/a>, however, at the 21<sup>st<\/sup> United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference, set to take place in Paris in 2015. The UNFCCC is expected to set a global protocol for the reduction of CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions, to be enacted in 2020. The clarity from such a protocol is expected to set the market for carbon at a level sufficiently high to justify investments in environmentally friendly technologies, which would then give both producers and consumers of clean energy better visibility on their investments.<\/p>\n<p>The clean energy sector in the U.S. still has a long way to go. Unlike Europe and China, where the adoption of such technologies is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iea.org\/textbase\/npsum\/mtrenew2013sum.pdf\">progressing rapidly<\/a>, American producers have yet to reach the critical mass required to bring down prices, and consumers still lack a real incentive  8211  other than a desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  8211  or even options to switch to such sources of energy. This will gradually change as the industry matures but will require U.S. policymakers to push for energy independence.<\/p>\n<p>The turmoil in the Middle East should motivate us to act. In a high-tech world, all commercial activity depends on a stable, sufficient and affordable source of energy. That energy has historically come primarily from oil, but just as natural gas has emerged as a crucial fuel in this environment, it\u2019s time for clean energy to catch up as well. It\u2019s no longer just an environmental imperative but an economic one.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sanjay Sanghoee is a political and business commentator.

While it\u2019s not clear just how much ZMapp, a three-antibody cocktail still in preclinical drug development, had to do with it\u2014other Ebola-stricken patients given the treatment did not survive\u2014the news has shined a spotlight on a little-known and even less funded fron\u00adtier of drug production: plant-made pharmaceuticals.<\/p>\n<p>Manufacturing drugs in plants, a method sometimes called pharming, is not a new concept. <em>Fortune<\/em> first wrote about its potential in 1988, and Monsanto developed antibodies in soybeans in the \u201990s, including one for herpes. But early techniques, which involved genetically modified plants and outdoor cultivation, were clunky and inspired fears that food and pharmaceutical crops would cross-pollinate. Interest in the field was limited, and the drug industry pushed ahead with antibody production in a different medium, one that might strike an outsider as no less radical than tobacco: Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cells. The process, carried out in specially designed, highly regulated facilities that house the stainless-steel vats in which the CHO cells grow, is both capital-intensive and slow. But even so, making drugs in hamster and other mammalian cells has become the Big Pharma standard.<\/p>\n<p style=\"width:475px line-height:1em text-align:center border:8px color:white background-color:black padding:7px margin-left:25px \"><span style=\"font-size:24px font-weight:bold \">DARPA, the Pentagon   s quirky-ideas factory challenged tobacco  8220 pharmers 8221  to produce 10 million doses of flu vaccine in one month. They pulled it off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Over the past two decades, though, pharming has advanced sharply, helped along by government agencies, cash-strapped biotechs, and, yes, the tobacco industry. Plants used in drug manufacturing are now grown in closed, indoor facilities, often with hydroponics, which produces a more uniform crop. And plants are no longer genetically modified but simply \u201cinfiltrated\u201d\u2014submerged in solution\u2014with a modified plant virus that reprograms them to make the desired pharmaceutical protein. Once infiltrated, leaves begin producing drugs in just hours. Within days, they\u2019re harvested, ground up, and filtered, and the medicine is purified.<\/p>\n<p>While pharming can work in other plants\u2014carrot cells, for instance, are used to manufacture Elelyso, a medication for the genetic disorder Gaucher\u2019s disease and currently the only FDA-approved plant-made drug\u2014\u00adtobacco lends itself particularly well to the process. That\u2019s because it\u2019s leafy (the more biomass from which to squeeze out protein), fast growing, and thanks to tobacco companies, well understood.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/mac22_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/mac22_1.jpg?w=1024 038 h=686\" alt=\"Caliber can produce an antibody-infused tobacco plant in just weeks.  \" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" class=\"size-full wp-image-780641\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Caliber can produce an antibody-infused tobacco plant in just weeks.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo by Dan Winters for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Charles Arntzen, regents\u2019 professor at Arizona State University and a renowned expert in the realm of greenhouse meds, says antibodies manufactured in plants have proved as effective as (or more so than) those made in CHO cells. They\u2019re also quicker and cheaper to produce. A 2011 study published in the <em>Journal of Commercial Biotechnology<\/em> estimated, conservatively, that making drugs in plant cells costs just two-thirds of what it does in mammalian ones.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the pharmaceutical industry has been slow to go green. (Several big drug companies contacted by <em>Fortune<\/em> had no comment on plant-based manufacturing other than to note they don\u2019t use it.) That has left the exploration to others. Like the Pentagon. In 2009 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, launched Blue Angel, a program that challenged three tobacco pharming facilities\u2014among them, Kentucky BioProcessing and Texas-based Caliber Biotherapeutics (shown in the photo above)\u2014to produce 10 million doses of flu vaccine in one month. The reward? Tens of millions in funding.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, the process has drawn interest from nonprofits, which see its potential for addressing infectious-disease outbreaks and neglected illnesses. The Gates Foundation, for one, is working with iBio, one of the few publicly traded \u201cplantibody\u201d companies, to make low-cost vaccines for developing countries.<\/p>\n<p>As for the current West African outbreak of Ebola, pharming could perhaps offer a test case for containment. If ZMapp ultimately proves effective against the virus, experts say production could be ramped up to the necessary scale in months.

She is describing a slightly creepy \u201cbiofabricated\u201d product made by a startup the foundation funded with a $350,000 donation. The company, named Modern Meadow, makes leather and, indeed, meat by taking skin or muscle samples from animals via biopsy and then growing them in vitro. Modern Meadow is just one of 19 futuristic startups that have received donations from the Thiel Foundation over the past two years as part of an unusual program called Breakout Labs. Though it is rare, if not unheard-of, for a charitable foundation to donate tax-advantaged dollars to for-profit companies, the Thiel Foundation is no ordinary charity. It was set up in 2006 by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, who crafts his gifts to make a point, as he explains to <em>Fortune<\/em> in an interview. \u201cYou want to pick an issue where it both does some good on its own,\u201d he says, \u201cand at the same time helps draw awareness to a broader set of issues.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Breakout Labs shines a spotlight on a contrarian contention Thiel has been advancing in essays, talks, and debates since about 2008, which has come to be known as the \u201ctech stagnation thesis.\u201d Thiel contends that the amazing advances we have seen in computer science and communications have masked ominously disappointing progress in energy, transportation, biotech, disease prevention, and space travel. That slowdown, he maintains, accounts for the near stagnation in real incomes and wages we have experienced since 1973, and for widening inequality in wealth distribution.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the last 40 years in the technology world,\u201d as Thiel puts it, \u201cwe\u2019ve had enormous progress in the world of bits, but not as much in the world of atoms.\u201d The notion is encapsulated in the tag line of Thiel\u2019s venture capital firm, Founders Fund: \u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To address this problem, his Breakout Labs supports only \u201chard tech\u201d startups\u2014ventures that aren\u2019t focusing on websites, social media, or information technology\u2014and those that are too speculative to attract angel investors or even government grants. He gives these companies a shot of capital with which to try to prove that their technology works in hopes that they will then be able to attract conventional VC funding\u2014as Modern Meadow managed to do this past June.<\/p>\n<p>A gifted rhetorician and provocateur with a bottomless pocketbook, Thiel has drawn upon his wide-ranging and idiosyncratic readings in philosophy, history, economics, anthropology, and culture to become perhaps America\u2019s leading public intellectual today, assuming a mantle once held by the likes of Thorstein Veblen or Norman Mailer. The conspicuous difference is that Thiel\u2014a libertarian, gay Christian\u2014espouses views that are far harder to anticipate, and he has earned his pulpit largely through commercial rather than literary or scholarly masterworks.<\/p>\n<p>In 1998, Thiel co-founded the pioneering e-commerce payments company PayPal, which was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Among students of business, PayPal may be known less for its own success than for the subsequent achievements of the people Thiel helped attract to build it. Those individuals, now known as the PayPal mafia, went on to launch a raft of companies that have become household names, including at least seven now valued at more than $1 billion: Tesla <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"TSLA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/tsla\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">TSLA<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and SpaceX (co-founded by Elon Musk), LinkedIn <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"LNKD\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/lnkd\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">LNKD<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> (Reid Hoffman), YouTube (Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim), Yelp <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"YELP\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/yelp\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">YELP<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> (Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons), Yammer (David O.

In 2004 he famously gave the 20-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard sophomore who had never held a steady job, $500,000 in exchange for 10.2% of the company then called Thefacebook. The investment has so far netted Thiel more than $1 billion in cash  he retains a $200 million stake and remains a Facebook director. Other notable Thiel investments, either individually or through Founders Fund, have included LinkedIn  Spotify  a $120 million stake in Musk\u2019s rocket-ship company, SpaceX  and more recently Airbnb.<\/p>\n<p>Thiel\u2019s public profile began extending beyond the Valley in 2010, when he was depicted in the movie <em>The Social Network<\/em>. This year HBO\u2019s <em>Silicon Valley<\/em> television series introduced the world to a brilliant eccentric named Peter Gregory, who is widely understood to have been inspired by Thiel. In the first episode Gregory delivers a speech promoting a program almost identical to Thiel\u2019s controversial \u201c20 Under 20\u201d project, launched in late 2010, which annually offers 20 young tech phenoms $100,000 if they\u2019ll drop out of school to launch a startup.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-779856\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_5.jpg?w=990 038 h=660\" alt=\"HBO Silicon Valley\" width=\"990\" height=\"660\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">At left, the eccentric tycoon character Peter Gregory in HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley is thought to be based on Thiel.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Jaimie Trueblood\u2014HBO<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Later this month Thiel\u2019s fame will probably balloon further when he publishes <em>Zero to One: Notes on Startups<\/em>, or <em>How to Build the Future<\/em>. The title refers to the distinction Thiel draws between transformative, \u201cvertical\u201d change\u2014going from zero to one\u2014and incremental, \u201chorizontal\u201d change\u2014going from one to n. \u201cIf you take one typewriter and build 100, you have made horizontal progress,\u201d he explains in the book\u2019s first chapter. \u201cIf you have a typewriter and build a word processor, you have made vertical progress.\u201d (<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/peter-thiels-the-challenge-of-the-future\" target=\"_blank\">Read excerpt here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe book is nominally about entrepreneurship,\u201d Zuckerberg observes in an interview with <em>Fortune<\/em>, \u201cbut what I actually think it\u2019s about is the philosophy of how you go about creating value in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Zero to One<\/em> is based on what Silicon Valley digerati knowingly refer to as \u201cCS183\u201d\u2014the catalogue designation for the undergraduate computer science course Thiel taught during Stanford\u2019s spring 2012 trimester. Thiel\u2019s lectures became an online sensation after Stanford law student Blake Masters, then 25, began posting\u2014originally without permission\u2014reconstructions of each one on his Tumblr blog.<\/p>\n<p>After his fourth installment became the subject of a <em>New York Times<\/em> op-ed column by David Brooks, Masters recalls, he decided to check with Thiel to see if he minded. \u201cGo ahead and keep posting,\u201d Thiel emailed back. Masters\u2019 blog has since received close to 2.4 million page views from 560,000 unique visitors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe course notes have had a huge impact,\u201d venture capitalist Marc Andreessen tells me. \u201cEvery entrepreneur we meet has read those back to back.\u201d Andreessen co-wrote the code for the first modern web browser and co-founded the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.<\/p>\n<p>When Thiel decided to write the current book\u2014a pared-down, more elegant treatment of the same material, with some additions\u2014he turned for help to Masters, who is now listed as the book\u2019s co-author.<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, perhaps, Masters has also now founded his own startup, a software-turbocharged legal analytics tool. Thiel led its $2 million seed round.<\/p>\n<p>Thiel, 46, is more youthful, energetic, and fit than his on-screen impersonators. At our first interview he is dressed in a black V-neck sweater, khakis, and high-end sneakers. He has invited me to breakfast\u2014a vegetable omelet for me, just fresh berries for him\u2014prepared by his private chef at his airy, contemporary headquarters amid the eucalyptus-scented hills of San Francisco\u2019s Presidio. Picture windows afford views of the Palace of Fine Arts against the backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge, Angel Island, and Alcatraz.<\/p>\n<p>Though Thiel has become a living emblem of Silicon Valley, he has actually lived and worked in San Francisco since late 2002. He moved here from Mountain View, after selling PayPal, to chart a new beginning.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEntrepreneurs who are very successful always run the risk of competing with their past selves,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you win a gold medal in the Olympics, my bias would be you should quit swimming that day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an extraordinary statement from someone who has so obviously thrived on competition all his life. A couple of chess sets stand at the ready barely 10 yards from where we\u2019re chatting. These are not the intricately carved, ornamental keepsakes of a collector, but rather the regulation Staunton sets of a master-level player, with timer clocks alongside.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, devaluing competition is a central theme of Thiel\u2019s new book. He asserts that \u201ccapitalism and competition are opposites,\u201d because \u201cunder perfect competition, all profits get competed away.\u201d He exhorts entrepreneurs to seek out monopolies, concluding, \u201cAll happy companies are different: Each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: They failed to escape competition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Andreessen, a friend and frequent co-investor with Thiel, says he agrees with \u201cexactly half\u201d of whatever Thiel says, and that Thiel\u2019s denunciation of competition is a good example. \u201cHe\u2019s right, in that you should try to do something that nobody\u2019s competing with,\u201d says Andreessen. \u201cBut he\u2019s wrong in that, if it\u2019s a good idea, there are going to be other people doing it. And then what? Gonna give up? Well, no. You\u2019re going to compete.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Andreessen credits Thiel with having a positive impact on Valley culture. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be around Peter and not think, \u2018I have to get smarter,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWhen it comes to philosophy, history, politics, the fate of humanity\u2014Peter has up-leveled the discussion a lot. Before Peter, not a lot of people were thinking about these topics. People were thinking, \u2018What\u2019s the new chip?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Born in October 1967 in Frankfurt, West Germany, Thiel grew up as a gifted outsider. His father was an engineer whose jobs required the family to move often\u2014to America, then to Africa, then back\u2014forcing Thiel to change elementary schools seven times. The family took root in the Bay Area in 1977, when Thiel was 10.<\/p>\n<p>Thiel began playing chess when he was 6, and by age 12 was ranked seventh in the U.S. in the under-13 category. (He continued to play tournament chess into his thirties and still plays \u201cblitz chess\u201d\u2014five-minute games\u2014over the Internet.) He also excelled in math, scoring first in a California-wide mathematics test while attending public school in San Mateo.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_1.jpg\"><img class=\" aligncenter size-full wp-image-779852\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_1.jpg?w=533 038 h=723\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"723\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Thiel was born in Frankfurt, West Germany, in 1967, to an engineer father whose international travels required Thiel to change elementary schools seven times. He is shown here in South Africa in 1975, at about age 8.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Courtesy of Peter Thiel<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In high school Thiel admired the optimism and anti-communism of President Ronald Reagan, who gave him a sense that \u201cthere were sort of like all these answers that had finally been figured out and that were right.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In 1985, when he entered Stanford as a freshman, the college was in the process of snubbing an opportunity to house the Reagan Library. It was also modifying its traditional Great Books curriculum to accommodate the then-ascendant multiculturalist critique. Pushing back against \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d in 1987, Thiel co-founded the Stanford Review, a journal of conservative and libertarian viewpoints, and was its first editor-in-chief.<\/p>\n<p>In college Thiel became captivated by the teachings of the French anthropological philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard, who was on Stanford\u2019s faculty. Girard has written extensively about a concept he calls \u201cmimetic desire\u201d\u2014our unconscious tendency to adopt the aspirations of our neighbors. In Girard\u2019s world imitation engenders competition, and competition engenders imitation.<\/p>\n<p>For Thiel, a contrarian by nature who later became a hedge fund manager, startup founder, and venture capitalist\u2014all posts requiring an ability to reject herd mentalities, shun market bubbles, and seize overlooked opportunities\u2014Girard\u2019s analysis of man\u2019s unconscious compulsion to imitate his fellow man was compelling. \u201cIt\u2019s been a powerful way of thinking for all these different contexts I\u2019ve found myself in over the years,\u201d says Thiel.<\/p>\n<p>Thiel now also identifies a more personal reason he was likely attracted to Girard in college: his own unconscious imitation of those around him. Thiel had then passively boarded a conveyor belt that would carry him from college to Stanford Law School, and thence to a position as a young transactional lawyer at New York\u2019s Sullivan &amp  Cromwell, a position near the pinnacle of that profession.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it was the unhappiest period of my whole life,\u201d recounts Thiel of his time at Sullivan. \u201cIt lasted seven months and three days.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There he endured a \u201cquarter-life crisis\u201d that appears to have shaped his mistrust of higher education. \u201cI enjoyed law school,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t ask the question of why I was doing this nearly enough. In retrospect, I was too competitive.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Upon leaving the law firm, Thiel became a derivatives trader at CS Financial Products, a unit of Credit Suisse. He found that more congenial, he says, but it still had a \u201ctracked character\u201d that felt wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Around Christmas 1994, while visiting his family on the West Coast, he spent a few days with his college friend Reid Hoffman. Though Hoffman had considered Thiel \u201cextremely right wing\u201d at Stanford and had then counted himself a socialist, the two had become fast friends, each placing great value on their intellectual sparring over philosophy, morality, and politics.<\/p>\n<p>Hoffman had aspired to become a public intellectual, by writing books and essays as a philosophy professor, but now he was tweaking his plan. \u201cI realized,\u201d he says in an interview, \u201cthat if you generalized what a public intellectual does to [creating] media objects\u201d\u2014i.e., not just books and essays\u2014\u201cthen one could possibly create software companies that had public intellectual impact.\u201d These would have \u201cthe strength of commercial models,\u201d he explains, and therefore also have the advantage of letting one \u201cplay the economic thing\u201d\u2014i.e., make money.<\/p>\n<p>As Thiel recalls the meeting, \u201cWe were thinking about all the different tech companies one could start, and there was a sense that something important was happening and it made sense to try to do something here,\u201d that is, in Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<p>Thiel made the break in early 1996, leaving New York for Menlo Park. He raised $1 million from friends and family and started his own hedge fund, Thiel Capital.<\/p>\n<p>A year later he met Luke Nosek, then 21, who was one of several engineers who\u2019d just left the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for Silicon Valley, following in the footsteps of Marc Andreessen. Hoping to launch a web-based calendar, Nosek asked Thiel for advice about fundraising. To his surprise, Thiel offered to invest $100,000 from his own fund, and did.<\/p>\n<p>The company failed. Nosek was racked with guilt at having lost Thiel\u2019s money: \u201cI just thought, \u2018Oh, my God. My friend. He offered to invest.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nosek\u2019s friend Max Levchin, another UIUC programmer, then asked Nosek to introduce him to Thiel so that he could pitch his idea for a cryptography-related company called Fieldlink. Nosek was still too ashamed to even speak to Thiel, so Levchin went behind his back, collaring Thiel after a talk he gave at Stanford. Thiel liked Levchin\u2019s idea and proposed becoming a co-founder. He and Levchin then asked Nosek to join them too.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd this is what\u2019s great about Peter,\u201d Nosek says. \u201cHe does not take friendship lightly. It\u2019s something that lasts slightly longer than forever. I was like, \u2018Oh, I screwed this thing up.\u2019 But it didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t like it. He was mad. But it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Fieldlink changed directions and names a couple of times and became PayPal. In picking their team, Thiel and Levchin brought in only people whom at least one of them knew very well. Thiel persuaded Reid Hoffman to become a board member and also brought in David Sacks, who had been an editor-in-chief of the <em>Stanford Review<\/em> a few years after Thiel, as chief operating officer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeter was never a nuts-and-bolts operations guy,\u201d writes Sacks in an email. \u201cBut he had a knack for identifying all the big strategic issues and getting them right.\u201d In March 2000, he recalls, PayPal was raising a $100 million financing. Puffed up with the bravado of the dotcom bubble, most people wanted to hold out for better terms. \u201cPeter kicked everyone\u2019s butt to get the round closed,\u201d Sacks continues. \u201cA couple of days later the market crashed. Had we waited another week, the company would have died.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-779853\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_2.jpg?w=490 038 h=314\" alt=\"Peter thiel, Elon Musk\" width=\"490\" height=\"314\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Thiel (left) and Elon Musk in October 2000, about seven months after they merged the competing companies they had founded, forming PayPal.

He then started planning his second act, which would embrace three subplots: relaunching his hedge fund, becoming a venture capitalist, and founding a new billion-dollar company.<\/p>\n<p>In 2003, as Act II was getting underway, Thiel took care of an awkward task. He told some friends and associates that he was gay. Word spread quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s still one of these things that people in our society find incredibly important and interesting about other people,\u201d he says, with what sounds like annoyance.<\/p>\n<p>Some critics have suggested that the revelation exposed hypocrisy in certain of Thiel\u2019s earlier writings. During his years at the <em>Review<\/em>, he had been deeply skeptical of \u201cidentity politics.\u201d In 1995 he and Sacks published a book called <em>The Diversity Myth<\/em>, in which they argued that in the campus context, \u201cthose persons complaining about oppression are generally not the ones to have experienced it firsthand.\u201d In one disturbing passage they come to the defense of a law student friend who in 1992 had shouted an antigay slur outside the cottage of a gay resident fellow as a protest against campus speech codes. The authors argue that the law student\u2019s near-universal execration afterward, official and unofficial, was disproportionate to his offense.<\/p>\n<p>Asked about this incident in 2011, Thiel told <em>The New Yorker<\/em> that he regretted having written about it. \u201cAll the identity-related things are in my mind much more nuanced,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cI think there is a gay experience, I think there is a black experience, I think there is a woman\u2019s experience that is meaningfully different. I also think there was a tendency to exaggerate it and turn it into an ideological category.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In our interviews, Thiel said that he had not fully realized he was gay when he wrote the book. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have known,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I was somehow incredibly confused about it.\u201d Thiel has had a steady boyfriend for a number of years now, he says, but he preferred not to have additional details published.<\/p>\n<p>(To close the circle of pain, the former law student who shouted the antigay slur has also recently acknowledged a homosexual relationship. How does he look back at the 1992 incident? \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt was 22 years ago.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>Thiel put $10 million of his PayPal winnings into the hedge fund and relaunched it as Clarium Capital. \u201cThe big, macroeconomic idea that we had at Clarium\u2014the id\u00e9e fixe\u2014was the peak-oil theory,\u201d Thiel says, \u201cwhich was basically that the world was running out of oil, and that there were no easy alternatives\u2014either more oil or conservation or alternative energy.\u201d It was the first glimmer of his tech stagnation thesis.<\/p>\n<p>On the venture capital side he began angel-investing with his friend Hoffman. The two invested in social network startups, beginning with Hoffman\u2019s own LinkedIn in 2003 and culminating in the 2004 Facebook stake.<\/p>\n<p>Also in 2004, Thiel launched a new startup\u2014one whose business model was viewed as so outr\u00e9 that it initially attracted no Silicon Valley funding. At first its only backer, besides Thiel, was a not-for-profit called In-Q-Tel, which is the venture arm of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBasically,\u201d Thiel explains, \u201cI thought that some of the approaches that PayPal had used to fight fraud\u201d\u2014which at one point posed an existential threat to PayPal\u2014\u201ccould be extended into other contexts, like fighting terrorism.\u201d After 9\/11, he says, \u201cyou end up with this ideological debate which is sort of Vice President Cheney vs. the ACLU: Will we have more security with less privacy, or less security with more privacy? And my worry is that, whenever a terrorist attack happens, the ACLU will always lose.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What was missing from the debate, Thiel argues, was the recognition that with technological advances, \u201cyou could have more security with fewer privacy violations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/cov22_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-779878\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/cov22_2.jpg?w=750 038 h=1000\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">A master level chess player today, Thiel was, at age 12, ranked seventh in the U.S. in his age category.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Art Streiber for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So\u2014and, yes, many find this a shocking project for a libertarian to embark upon\u2014he founded Palantir, which would provide data-mining services to government intelligence agencies, but services that were, he insists, maximally unintrusive and traceable. Ten years later the market for its services has proved broader than many predicted, with more than 60% of its revenue last year coming from private sector clients. The company\u2019s last funding round valued it at $9 billion.<\/p>\n<p>After launching his venture capital firm, Founders Fund, in 2005, Thiel was ready in 2006 to kick off the Thiel Foundation, through which he channels his heuristic charitable giving. It gives away about $13 million to $15 million a year.<\/p>\n<p>An early beneficiary was Aubrey de Grey, the highly controversial biogeronotologist who founded the SENS Research Foundation, which stands for Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence. De Grey is trying to develop regenerative therapies that can postpone aging\u2014possibly indefinitely. In an email, De Grey confirms to me that he still believes, as he was once quoted saying, that the first human who will live to be 1,000 is probably already alive today.<\/p>\n<p>Thiel\u2019s support for anti-aging research is perhaps the most extreme manifestation of his being a \u201cdefinite optimist\u201d\u2014a person who, as Thiel defines the term in <em>Zero to One<\/em>, believes \u201cthe future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it better.\u201d Thiel contrasts such a person to an indefinite optimist, someone who thinks \u201cthe future will be better, but \u2026 doesn\u2019t know how exactly, so he won\u2019t make any specific plans.\u201d Thiel abhors the latter outlook, which he feels predominates in America.<\/p>\n<p>A second notorious Thiel charity is the Seasteading Institute, which he co-founded in 2008 with the aim of launching floating cities outside the reach of existing governments. In our conversations, however, Thiel spoke of this project almost in the past tense, noting that \u201cit\u2019s quite hard to do, both technologically and culturally.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thiel\u2019s most infamous charitable project has probably been his 20 Under 20 program, which provides gifted students between the ages of 18 and 20 with $100,000 to launch their own startups. The program empowers \u201cdefinite optimists,\u201d but also highlights Thiel\u2019s view that we are in an \u201ceducation bubble,\u201d in which colleges saddle undergraduates with needless debt by tricking them into thinking their degrees will be worth more than they really will be.<\/p>\n<p>There has been pushback. Former Harvard president Larry Summers called the program \u201cthe single most misdirected philanthropy in this decade,\u201d according to TechCrunch, while Slate Group chairman Jacob Weisberg wrote in <em>Newsweek<\/em>, \u201cThiel fellows will have the opportunity to emulate their sponsor by halting their intellectual development around the onset of adulthood, maintaining a narrow-minded focus on getting rich as young as possible and thereby avoid the siren lure of helping others or pursuing knowledge for its own sake.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For all the controversy, it\u2019s a narrow program. \u201cIt\u2019s classic Peter,\u201d says Andreessen. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people in the academy freaking out like it\u2019s the death knell for organized education,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s 20 kids a year. Wake me up when it\u2019s 20,000 kids.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_8.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-779859\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/thi22_8.jpg?w=1024 038 h=768\" alt=\"Seasteading study\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">A design study for the Seasteading Institute, a group co-founded by Thiel that proposes to build floating cities beyond the reach of existing governments.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Anthony Ling\u2014The Seasteading Institute<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Since Thiel\u2019s credibility as a public intellectual is built in part on the presumed validation imparted by his financial success, the financial crisis of 2008 posed a threat to everything he had created. Though he experienced some rough sledding, he got through it.<\/p>\n<p>His hedge fund did get clobbered. Thiel\u2019s peak-oil thesis did well by Clarium until mid-2008, as the price of oil soared from about $40 a barrel in 2002 to nearly $140. During that stretch the fund swelled in value from about $10 million to more than $6 billion as stock valuations skyrocketed and new investors flocked to his door.<\/p>\n<p>But by February 2009 oil prices had temporarily fallen back to almost $40 again. And though Thiel had foreseen the real estate bubble, he still underestimated it. \u201cWe didn\u2019t fully believe our own theories about how bad things were,\u201d he admits.<\/p>\n<p>Worse, he overreacted and missed the rebound, causing Clarium to badly underperform in 2009 and 2010. Most institutional investors fled. Today Clarium\u2014with about $200 million under management\u2014handles just the money of Thiel, friends and family, and a few select investors.<\/p>\n<p>His flagship VC arm, on the other hand, Founders Fund, has fared very well. Its funds under management have grown from $50 million in 2005, when it closed its first fund, to $2 billion today, after its fifth fund closed in March. According to one limited partner who has been involved in every Founders Fund pool since 2007, performances have ranked in the \u201ctop quartile, if not the top decile\u201d of all VC funds of their vintage (i.e., the category determined by the year the fund closed), with annual returns in the 35% to 45% range.<\/p>\n<p>Though the 2008 financial crisis buffeted Thiel\u2019s world, it also made people more receptive to his \u201ctech slowdown thesis,\u201d Thiel says. Still, Thiel\u2019s hypothesis remains only that. Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, who has debated the issue with Thiel at Oxford, wrote that \u201cthe vast majority of my scientist colleagues at top universities seem awfully excited about their projects in nanotechnology, neuroscience, and energy, among other cutting-edge fields. They think they are changing the world at a pace as rapid as we have ever seen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At first glance, the optimism of Thiel\u2019s <em>Zero to One<\/em>, exhorting entrepreneurs to embark upon transformative acts of creation, might seem at odds with the pessimism of his tech stagnation theory. But the latter is actually the motivational backdrop for the former.<\/p>\n<p>When people look into the future, Thiel explains to me, the consensus is that globalization will take its course, with the developing world coming to look like the developed world. But people don\u2019t focus on the dark, Malthusian reality of what that will mean, absent major technological breakthroughs not currently in any pipeline.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf everyone in China has a gas-guzzling car, we\u2019ll have oil at $10 per gallon and enormous pollution,\u201d he observes.<\/p>\n<p>But that   s just the start, because without growth there will also be increasing political instability. Instability will lead to global conflict, and that in turn may lead to what in a 2007 essay he referred to as 8221  secular apocalypse 8221 \u2014total extinction of the human race through either thermonuclear war, biological contagion, unchecked climate change, or an array of competing Armageddon scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d he says, with characteristic understatement and aplomb, \u201cI think the stakes in this are not just, \u2018Are we going to have some new gadgets?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>This story is from the September 22, 2014 issue of Fortune.<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 4, 2014","published":"2014-09-04 07:03:50","updated":"2014-09-04 07:03:50","minute":"7:03 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/peter-thiels-contrarian-strategy\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/peter-thiels-contrarian-strategy\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"5\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3765744600001-5\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3765744600001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1u0vOEg\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp gdfp_req=1&amp impl=s&amp output=xml_vast2&amp iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/finance_bc&amp sz=1000x1&amp cust_params=tags%3Dadamlashinsky%2Cbubble%2Cfoundersfund%2Cipo%2Cpeterthiel%2Crogerparloff%2Ctechbubble%2Czerotoone%26ch%3Dfinance%26topic%3Dpeterthiel&amp unviewed_position_start=1&amp correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences() \n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"short_title":"Peter Thiel's Contrarian Strategy","excerpt":"<p>The tech financier and intellectual provocateur has some ideas that may turn you off.

The passion for outsize consumption that helped drive the world\u2019s largest economy for decades\u2014one nation, indivisibly united by an addiction to malls, supercenters, and retail therapy\u2014appears to have waned. After years of slow to stagnant growth, some experts worry that the entire retail sector is now shifting into a fundamental decline. Could the long American love affair with shopping finally be on the rocks? \u201cI talk to retail executives every day in this country, big, medium, and small,\u201d says Robin Lewis, an industry expert and the author of the widely followed <em>The Robin Report<\/em>, \u201cand they all say things are damn slow.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Damn slow, indeed. At a time of year when U.S. retailers should be riding the annual wave of back-to-school spending and gearing up for the bonanza of the ever-expanding holiday season, they are instead gloomily explaining continued lackluster results to Wall Street. Companies from Target to Kohl\u2019s to Coach have reported disappointing sales for several quarters running. Wal-Mart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, with $279 billion in sales in the U.S. alone, has seen a drop in store traffic in each of the past seven quarters. Once-shining brands such as Staples and Abercrombie &amp  Fitch are closing stores\u2014a reversal from the \u201cbuild it and they will come\u201d mentality that formerly served as a strategy. Even Apple, the king of sales per square foot, has seen a decline in same-store sales this year, according to Customer Growth Partners. Overall, according to eMarketer, retail spending in stores is expected to grow just 3.7% in 2014\u2014a fairly anemic rate some five years past the depths of the Great Recession. No wonder Kip Tindell, CEO of the Container Store, while reporting yet another quarter of poor numbers in early July, complained that the retail business was in a \u201cfunk.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What are the reasons for this malaise? Industry analysts and executives describe a perfect storm fueled by an unfettered addiction to promotions and discounts, continued economic instability, and the fact that there is simply too much store space for the current population. The result, says Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia University and former CEO of Sears Canada, will be a \u201cDarwinian struggle for survival,\u201d which may ultimately take down some of the best-known brands. Yes, e-commerce continues to grow rapidly, now accounting for an estimated 6.4% of sales, or $304 billion in 2014. But the bigger e-commerce gets, the more it is disrupting the industry as we know it.<\/p>\n<p>There are, of course, winners as well as losers in this new world\u2014not only the obvious online powers, such as Amazon, which continue to siphon off market share, but also more traditional brick-and-mortar plays like Dollar General and T.J. Maxx. And there are lessons in those success stories. U.S. shoppers haven\u2019t gone away altogether. But there is a \u201csea change in how people are shopping,\u201d says Daniel Busch, an analyst with real estate analysis firm Green Street Advisors. Retailers must change dramatically to reach future customers. To better understand how the business is evolving, we identified four major (and interrelated) trends that are roiling retail\u2014as well as possible solutions to each.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px \">PROBLEM NO. 1: <em>Death by Discount<\/em><\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s the oldest strategy in merchandising: offering shoppers an artificial price lower than \u201cretail\u201d to spur our primal desire for landing bargains. But over the past decade, say analysts, things have gotten way, way out of control. Virtually every retailer\u2014at both the high and the low end\u2014has fallen so deeply into the trap that discounting has become an expectation of customers rather than a bonus. \u201cThere\u2019s price deflation caused by ever-increasing discounts and price competition, which lowers the average transaction value,\u201d says Columbia University\u2019s Cohen. \u201cThat means you have to sell more things just to stay even.\u201d This phenomenon has been spurred in recent years by the ability of shoppers to \u201cshowroom,\u201d or compare prices on the web.<\/p>\n<p>The most obvious beneficiaries of the discount trend are the off-price retailers, which sell designer fashion and home goods at lower prices than customers typically find at department or specialty stores. A star pupil in this class is TJX, which runs the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/07\/24\/t-j-maxx-the-best-retail-store\/\" target=\"_blank\">is likely to overtake Macy\u2019s in revenue this year<\/a>. There are now about 2,000 T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, compared with 1,680 just five years ago.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/option.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-780349\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/option.jpg?w=550 038 h=243\" alt=\"option\" width=\"550\" height=\"243\" \/><\/a><span class=\"credit\">Sources: International Council of Shopping Centers  Company Filings<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In an attempt to win back some share, the department stores that the off-price chains have squeezed are getting in on the action. Saks Fifth Avenue, a part of Canadian retail conglomerate Hudson\u2019s Bay Co., now operates   department stores\u2014compared with 53 five years ago\u2014but has boosted the number of its OFF 5th outlet stores from 55 to 75 over the same period. And Nordstrom, long known for its high-end quality, expects that by 2016 it will have twice as many Nordstrom Rack outlets as full-service department stores.<\/p>\n<p>While mall traffic overall continues to fall\u2014some 15% of malls are expected to close or convert to other uses in the next decade, according to Green Street\u2014outlet malls are booming. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, there are now 340 outlet centers in the U.S., up from 311 in 2007. Developers like Tanger Factory Outlet Centers and Simon Property Group say they have plans to build many more in the coming years. That will only exacerbate the downward pressure.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px \"><span style=\"color:#ff0000 \">SOLUTION:<\/span> <em>End the Race to the Bottom<\/em><\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nFinding a way out of the discount trap has been elusive. The most daring attempt to do so\u2014former J.C. Penney CEO Ron Johnson\u2019s decision in 2012 to abruptly end most sale pricing in favor of \u201ceveryday low pricing\u201d\u2014was an unmitigated disaster. Johnson, who uncovered the shocking statistic that 72% of Penney\u2019s products were sold at 50% off or more, sought to do away with what he called \u201cthe disease.\u201d There was just one problem: If you\u2019re the only one trying to change things, it doesn\u2019t work. In the first year of Johnson\u2019s experiment, Penney\u2019s revenues dropped by a stunning $4.3 billion. Those sales were eagerly scooped up by the likes of Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s, who responded to Johnson\u2019s move with\u2014you guessed it\u2014even more discounting. Macy\u2019s recently lowered its 2014 sales forecast, and Kohl\u2019s is struggling to post consistent gains. Johnson, who was forced out in 2013, may have failed on execution. But the big retailers would be wise to study his analysis of the discount dilemma.<\/p>\n<p style=\"width:475px line-height:1em text-align:center border:8px color:white background-color:black padding:7px margin-left:25px \"><span style=\"font-size:24px font-weight:bold \">At least one expert sees a  8220 Darwinian struggle for survival, 8221  which may ultimately take down some of the best-known brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px \"><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px \">PROBLEM<\/span><\/strong> NO. 2: <em>Too Much Space<\/em><\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nWho would ever have imagined the decline of the supercenter? For much of the past three decades it was a no-fail concept. Pick a location with cheap real estate and a large nearby population, build a giant box with a vast supply of shelf space, and wait for the shoppers to show up in droves. Wal-Mart rode the supercenter strategy to No. 1 on the <em>Fortune<\/em> 500. Target and Best Buy followed suit and blossomed as well. But the era of megastore dominance may be coming to an end.<\/p>\n<p>A big reason is that today the U.S. has far too much shopping square footage for its population\u201452.4 square feet per capita, compared with, for example, 16.4 square feet in Germany, according to data from research firm CoStar and the International Council of Shopping Centers. It\u2019s not just supercenters either. The number of shopping centers with more than 50,000 square feet in the U.S. has doubled in the past 30 years, though growth has flattened recently. The first principle of U.S. retail has seemingly always been \u201cmore and bigger.\u201d But given the ease of buying anything from a stapler to a toilet online, a continually growing footprint only adds up to empty parking lots.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px \"><span style=\"color:#ff0000 \">SOLUTION:<\/span> <em>Shrink to Grow<\/em><\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nHome Depot CEO Frank Blake recognized the square-footage dilemma earlier than most. When he decided in 2008 to stop opening new stores (with exceptions for certain demographically shifting areas, such as North Dakota), most analysts and employees alike thought he was nuts. Wasn\u2019t the point of any public company to actively grow its business? \u201cIt was the right decision for us,\u201d Blake says, \u201cbut it was painful. All the muscle memory in the organization was around building new stores.\u201d Instead, Home Depot has invested that capital in both improving its existing stores and in building a better online presence. Under Blake, who is stepping down Nov. 1 after seven years in the job, Home Depot\u2019s stock doubled, showing Wall Street that there may be another way to think about growth.<\/p>\n<p>Other retailers are slowly getting the message. Two years ago Gap returned to same-store sales growth after closing dozens of U.S. stores. And growth in store counts at the 100 largest retailers by revenue has slowed to less than 3% from more than 12% three years ago, according to a recent Moody\u2019s report.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/sho22_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-779949\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/sho22_2.jpg?w=750 038 h=500\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Target\u2019s has seen its comp numbers fall in six of the past seven quarters.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Scott Olson\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px \"><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px \">PROBLEM<\/span><\/strong> NO. 3: <em>The Nonrecovery Recovery<\/em><\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nIt should surprise no one that lower-income shoppers continue to be price-sensitive. Why? The economy, stupid. Yes, the U.S. is growing again after the trauma of the Great Recession. But not everyone is feeling it. The bottom 20% of Americans in terms of income saw their real income grow only 19.5% between 1967 and 2012, while the top 5% earned 88% more. What\u2019s more, the way people use their disposable income has changed. For instance, think about the \u201csmartphone effect.\u201d With $100 or more per month going to service plans, apps, and music, consumers have less money for a new pair of shoes.<\/p>\n<p>Those economic trends help explain the ongoing stagnation at the likes of Target, which posted negative comparable sales for 2013 and has followed that up with two worrisome quarters this year. Not only are there too many big-box stores (see problem No. 2), but they are also mostly located in places that require a long drive\u2014an increasingly troublesome proposition in an era of high gas prices and food-stamp-benefit cuts.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px \"><span style=\"color:#ff0000 \">SOLUTION:<\/span> <em>Assume This Is the New Normal<\/em><\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nA morose economy has been a boon to Dollar General. Over the past five years the ultra-discount retailer has opened 2,500 new stores (for a total of 11,388), while its same-store sales have risen consistently. It succeeds by being hyper-local with fixed, low prices. Most of its stores are in municipalities with fewer than 20,000 people, and many are within walking distance of population centers.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the rest of the retail world, meanwhile, spent precious time waiting for customers to come back to them. Few are counting on that anymore. Wal-Mart, for instance, is now trying to counteract the success of Dollar General and other dollar-store chains by speeding up the rollout of its own small-format stores in population-dense locations: Its goal is to have 700 by February, compared with around 400 at the beginning of 2014.<\/p>\n<p>In an environment of perpetually yo-yoing consumer confidence, retailers must either win clearly on price and convenience, or wow shoppers with such an innovative product or unique buying experience that they can\u2019t help opening their wallets. That leads us to\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px \"><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px \">PROBLEM<\/span><\/strong> NO. 4: <em>Stunted Evolution<\/em><\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nIf any single trend in retail is crystal clear, it\u2019s this: Online sales will continue to boom. E-commerce sales should leap 61% by 2018, according to eMarketer, reaching $491.5 billion. Brick-and-mortar sales, still a vastly larger number, are expected to grow a decidedly more modest 12.8% to about $5 trillion, from $4.43 trillion, over the same period.<\/p>\n<p>Adapting to this brave new world has proved difficult for many in the sector. While virtually every retailer participates in online sales, not all do it well. And the long tail enabled by the web means that a growing portion of overall sales is going to retailers with no physical stores. The digital experience is changing shopping habits in other ways too. Even when customers do choose to purchase items in a store, they frequently do research online first and then go straight for the item without stopping to browse. That reduces spontaneous purchases and harms retailers without great inventory controls.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/sho_graphic_b1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-780344\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/sho_graphic_b1.jpg?w=550 038 h=311\" alt=\"SHO_GRAPHIC_B[1]\" width=\"550\" height=\"311\" \/><\/a><span class=\"credit\">Graphic Source: eMarketer, April 2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px \"><span style=\"color:#ff0000 \">SOLUTION:<\/span> <em>Blend the Old With the New<\/em><\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nMalls are particularly vulnerable to the ease of online shopping. Busch of Green Street Advisors estimates that about 15% of items typically stocked in malls are now regularly purchased online. Some mall operators have grasped that reality, investing in their \u201cA\u201d malls, which cater to the high end, and adding new features and services such as gyms and wine bars. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a salad and a glass of wine online,\u201d says Michael Glimcher, CEO of mall REIT Glimcher Realty Trust.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the right idea. To thrive in an online world, retailers must enhance the excitement of the physical shopping experience while at the same time smothering customers with convenience. Happily, some major chains have lately been making better use of the very asset naysayers say condemns them to irrelevance: their stores. For instance, Wal-Mart\u2019s online business is now growing faster than Amazon\u2019s, thanks to big investments it has made to enable customers to place orders online and pick them up in many of the 3,300 or so Wal-Mart supercenters that dot the country. And Macy\u2019s uses most of its 810 stores to help it fill e-commerce orders more quickly and not have to move as much unsold, extra merchandise on clearance. Getting better at this \u201comnichannel\u201d approach is essential for any retailer planning to succeed with physical stores.<\/p>\n<p>Is there hope yet for U.S. retail? Only if retailers themselves understand that the classic assumptions about the way people shop are no longer valid. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t stopped wanting things, and they won\u2019t stop wanting things,\u201d Cohen says. \u201cThe economy will eventually repair itself. But where are they going to transact?

Ringed by a lush jungle on one side and magnificent views of the Andaman Sea on the other, its 40 Thai-style villas gently cascade down the hillside of a former coconut plantation, guaranteeing complete privacy for the royalty, celebrities, and tycoons who have been vacationing there for more than a quarter of a century. Amanpuri is the flagship of Aman Resorts, a glittering constellation of 26 properties stretching from Asia to Europe to North Africa and the U.S. Among its habitu\u00e9s is a group of passionate repeat customers who call themselves \u201cAman junkies.\u201d The resorts beguile them with their discreet luxury, exquisite attention to detail, otherworldly service, and breathtaking locales.

It\u2019s an experience unrivaled anywhere else. At the Aman at Summer Palace in Beijing, guests have access to a secret door that opens onto the east gate of the palace gardens. At the Aman Grand Canal in Venice, they are allowed to visit the Doge\u2019s Palace and clock tower in St. Mark\u2019s Square after hours.<\/p>\n<p>The company has long eschewed advertising, relying largely on its elite clientele to quietly spread the word. Bill Gates has been a guest. In March, Mark Zuckerberg holidayed at the Amanraya in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Just days after Novak Djokovic\u2019s Wimbledon win, the tennis champion was married at the Aman Sveti Stefan on the Adriatic Coast in Montenegro.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ama-celebs.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-780782\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ama-celebs.jpg?w=1024 038 h=323\" alt=\"Aman Resorts\" width=\"1024\" height=\"323\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Bill Gates, Sheryl Sandberg, and Mark Zuckerberg have all stayed at Aman Resorts.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photos, from left: Zacharias Abubeker\u2014AFP\/Getty Images  Scott Olson\u2014Getty Images  Justin Sullivan\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As a business, Aman is considered enticing, in part because it hasn\u2019t fulfilled its potential\u2014producing estimated annual revenues of just $202 million and operating profits of around $45 million. Having pursued a strategy of pricey rates (rooms start at $1,500 a night), no seasonal discounting, and deliberately limited capacity, Aman has maintained its exclusivity. But occupancy runs at around 30%, compared with an average of 76% for the rest of the elite-hotel sector. As a result, Aman has seemed like a sterling-but-untapped brand that, with the right investments and strategy, could bring its profits in line with the ardor of its fans.<\/p>\n<p>So last year, when DLF, India\u2019s largest commercial real estate developer, signaled its desire to sell Aman, suitors came calling. The luxury conglomerate LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, the private equity titans Carlyle Group and Blackstone, and a Chinese state-owned enterprise had all made moves. In the end, however, an unlikely pair\u2014Omar Amanat, a 42-year-old American entrepreneur, and Vladislav Doronin, a Russian property mogul in his early fifties\u2014prevailed with a bid of $358 million.<\/p>\n<p>The glow of their triumph wouldn\u2019t last. The partnership between Amanat and Doronin imploded with a velocity exceeded only by the speed at which it was put together. Conflict erupted, with allegations of fraud, conspiracy, extortion, intimidation, breach of contract, and an attempted coup. Relations between the two deteriorated so dramatically that at one point, Doronin told Amanat, according to a claim in the latter\u2019s legal filings, \u201cIf I feel you tried to screw me, I will hunt you down and shoot you.\u201d A Doronin spokesperson denies the allegation.<\/p>\n<p>Then came the lawsuits, massing some 30 attorneys in New York and London and featuring an international cast of characters that includes Adrian Zecha, Aman\u2019s 81-year-old Singapore-based founder, and Johan Eliasch, the 52-year-old London-based CEO of sporting goods firm Head. A new hearing, following a series of temporary injunctions that were issued in July, was scheduled for Sept. 15 in the London High Court.<\/p>\n<p>With Amanat and Doronin locked in a nasty feud as each vies for control, Aman\u2014the word means \u201cpeace\u201d in Sanskrit\u2014is anything but tranquil. At stake is the future of the company. Beyond that, mysteries abound, most particularly: Who, exactly, are the two men brawling for this prize?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline \"><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px color:red text-decoration:underline \">2. The Trader, The Supermodel, and The Poet<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nOmar Amanat believed he was perfectly positioned to make a deal when he heard Aman (the resemblance of the resort\u2019s name to his surname is coincidental) was up for sale in May 2013. A professed Aman junkie who says he has invested in hotels, he notes, \u201cIt was a trophy asset, and I was interested in buying it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The son of Indian immigrants, Amanat grew up in Queens, N.Y., and later New Jersey. His career originated in his father\u2019s basement. As stock trading\u2014including the rapid in-and-out version known as day trading\u2014became a frenzied pastime for some middle-class types in the 1990s, his dad set up a tiny operation downstairs in the family house.<\/p>\n<p>At age 23, Amanat joined Datek, a well-known day-trading outfit, and he says he later helped build a stock-trading platform that let regular investors track every buy and sell order for a specific stock in real time, just as the professionals at the big brokerage houses did. In 1997 he founded Tradescape, a direct-access brokerage firm. By 2000 the company had acquired four subsidiaries, including MarketXT, and was generating estimated annual revenues of $140 million. Amanat says he fielded numerous acquisition offers. \u201cTradescape was the biggest day-trading company,\u201d he boasts.<\/p>\n<p>In 2002, Amanat sold Tradescape to E*Trade for $100 million in stock plus an additional $180 million if the company hit certain targets. It seemed a moment of exultation and riches, but the bubble quickly burst, and Amanat became entangled in lengthy litigation (more on that later).<\/p>\n<p>Despite the turmoil of his court fight, Amanat presented a serene face to the world: a glamorous mix of wealth, elegance, and more than a dollop of substance. He was a man about town, charismatic and dashing\u2014with a trademark scarf draped over his well-cut blazer\u2014the sort who could seduce a supermodel (in fact, he married one: Helena Houdov\u00e1, his second wife, from whom he is separated). Amanat was also fond of quoting the 13th-century Persian poet Rumi.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ama22-merged-couples.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-780761\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ama22-merged-couples.jpg?w=1024 038 h=584\" alt=\"Aman Resort\" width=\"1024\" height=\"584\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Left, Omar Amanat and his wife, Helena Houdov\u00e1 (the couple are now separated), arrive at a screening of Darfur Now, for which he was an executive producer, in 2007.

Among the accolades recorded on his personal website is being named one of Wall Street\u2019s Top 10 Most Influential Technologists and one of the Top 500 Most Influential Muslims in the World. He sat on the boards of Human Rights Watch and Malaria No More. And various Amanat-related websites credit him with co-founding the UN-affiliated Alliance of Civilizations Media Fund and Bridges TV, a television network aimed at countering negative stereotypes of Islam.<\/p>\n<p>Amanat, who has been occasionally spotted at Cannes, also has his Hollywood side: He shared executive-producer credits with former eBay president Jeff Skoll on two films. An investment vehicle that Amanat and his family were part of was once the largest shareholder in Summit Entertainment, the studio behind the <em>Twilight<\/em> franchise (and since acquired by Lionsgate).<\/p>\n<p>With Aman in his sights, Amanat would need to call on more than financial resources  he needed allies too. Adrian Zecha, Aman\u2019s founder, was the first person he would have to woo.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline \"><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px color:red text-decoration:underline \">3. The Zen Hotelier<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nAman Resorts was born by accident. Zecha, the son of a wealthy Indonesian landowner, had owned magazines before migrating to the hotel business, where he co-founded the luxury Asian chain Regent Hotels. In 1986 he sold his stake for $30 million and decided to construct a vacation home in Phuket. When banks refused to lend him the money he needed to build in the inaccessible location, he brought in friends and investors. To subsidize the costs, he constructed several villas and rented them out. Thus, in 1988, Aman Resorts was created.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ama22_3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-780693\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ama22_3.jpg?w=1024 038 h=678\" alt=\"Adrian Zecha, Aman Resorts\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Aman founder Adrian Zecha in 2001 at the company\u2019s original resort in Phuket, Thailand.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Peter Charlesworth\u2014Lightrocket\/Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Aman brought a new approach to luxury lodgings. Zecha\u2019s concept was to create an atmosphere similar to visiting the home of a friend\u2014a very rich one with exquisite taste. His ethos was the spare, Zenlike antithesis of the grand hotel: no chandeliers, no reception desks, and no elevators. Each property was unique\u2014run as its manager saw fit\u2014and each took its design cues from the surrounding environment. \u201cIt\u2019s almost indescribable how Aman works,\u201d says Lyn Middlehurst, editor and publisher of the luxury travel bible <em>Gallivanter\u2019s Guide<\/em>. \u201cIt comes from the top, and it\u2019s Adrian\u2019s vision.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Zecha was obsessed with details. He would personally select the bedsheets and reportedly spent upwards of $350,000 on one room. When it came to location, he was single-minded. Miltos Kambourides, whose firm owns the Amanzoe in Greece, recalls that when the two joined forces in 2004, Zecha gave him very specific instructions about how the property should \u201cbe off the beaten track, have virgin nature, unobstructed views, access to a great waterfront and beach, and be surrounded by points of interest.\u201d When Kambourides brought Zecha to his proposed site two years later, he says, \u201che got out of the car and simply said, \u2018This is an Aman site,\u2019\u201d and then left.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years a pattern emerged in Zecha\u2019s ownership: He would start selling his shares and even depart the company\u2014but he would always come back. For example, Zecha left after Colony Capital, the real estate investment fund, took a majority position in the \u201990s and considered expanding the brand. Zecha then returned as chairman in 2007, when DLF, which wanted to expand into ultra-luxury hospitality, bought Aman for a reported $400 million, including debt.<\/p>\n<p>The global economic collapse interrupted DLF\u2019s growth plans, and by 2010 it was looking to unload Aman. Zecha attempted to buy the company back but couldn\u2019t raise the financing. When Omar Amanat came calling in 2013, Zecha was negotiating to acquire the resorts in concert with Carlyle. The talks fizzled, and Amanat and Zecha met. \u201cI told him I supported his vision,\u201d says Amanat. \u201cI wanted to grow and nurture this company for a lifetime. I had great ideas about how to grow the business in a way that doesn\u2019t degrade the brand.\u201d The two formed a partnership to pursue Aman.<\/p>\n<p>Amanat says many private equity firms, companies, and individuals were eager to finance the deal. But then he heard about a billionaire named Vladislav Doronin.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline \"><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px color:red text-decoration:underline \">4. The Billionaire<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nLittle has been published in the English-language press about the businesses of Vladislav Doronin. Indeed, public records and even the Internet are strikingly lacking in records of his commercial interests and interactions. Doronin is often described as a Russian oligarch, a term that suggests dealings tied to political connections\u2014a label his camp resists. \u201cHe is a self-made businessman and a gentleman,\u201d says one associate. (Doronin declined to be interviewed, but his press and legal representatives answered questions.) The associate did offer that the billionaire is passionate about architecture, real estate, and art, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s sporty, if you\u2019ve seen pictures of him.\u201d Indeed, Doronin has the muscled presence of a Dolph Lundgren.<\/p>\n<p>Doronin was born in what was then Leningrad in the Soviet Union. He moved to Geneva in 1985 to work as a trader for Marc Rich, the \u201cking of commodities,\u201d who was infamous for fleeing the U.S. after a grand jury indicted him on some 50 counts of fraud, racketeering, tax evasion, and trading with Iran. (President Bill Clinton pardoned Rich in a controversial 2001 decision  he died last year.)<\/p>\n<p>Doronin returned to Russia in the early 1990s, just as the country was transitioning to a market economy. Over the next 25 years he amassed an estimated $2.5 billion fortune in Moscow real estate.<\/p>\n<p>The public details of Doronin\u2019s transactions may be scant, but the same cannot be said of his personal life. Referred to in the British press as the \u201cRussian Donald Trump,\u201d Doronin is perhaps best known as the ex-boyfriend of supermodel Naomi Campbell. Before they split in 2013, the pair were regular figures on the international party circuit, photographed aboard his yacht, as well as in a fashion shoot for Russian Vogue and at his various homes around the world.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ama22_5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-780695\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ama22_5.jpg?w=1024 038 h=682\" alt=\"Aman Resorts, Aman Grand Canal Venicwe\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Inside Aman\u2019s property on the Grand Canal in Venice. Most of the company\u2019s resorts are spare, but the chain allows each its own unique aesthetic.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Frederic Lagrange\u2014Trunk Archive<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Amanat and Doronin were introduced through acquaintances on Dec. 11, 2013, at Doronin\u2019s apartment at the Mandarin Oriental in New York. An Aman devotee himself, Doronin was enthusiastic about being part of a deal. According to one of his advisers, the billionaire viewed Aman as a jewel of an opportunity. Its private villas (some of which are sold to individuals) are the most lucrative aspect of Aman\u2019s business, according to the adviser. Doronin\u2019s strategy was to invest more in developing villas for sale and rental, while opening up other hotels in city centers rather than just in resort locations, Aman\u2019s traditional focus.<\/p>\n<p>Amanat struck Doronin as a highly successful entrepreneur, one who was well-off. Amanat told him he had made more than $200 million selling shares of Twitter, according to Doronin\u2019s legal papers, and had more than $100 million in liquid assets. He said he was ready, the papers contend, to invest tens of millions of his own funds. Amanat was seeking a partner to inject additional financing. (Amanat\u2019s vehicle for the investment was Peak Ventures, whose assets include his money as well as that of family and friends.)<\/p>\n<p>Amanat\u2019s impression of their first encounter was very different. Upon entering Doronin\u2019s apartment, he says, he was greeted by an \u201cinappropriate sexual painting.\u201d Amanat claims that Doronin peppered discussion of a potential deal with crude sexual jokes. (A spokesperson denies that Doronin\u2019s art is inappropriate  he says the billionaire doesn\u2019t recall making sexual jokes.) In retrospect, says Amanat, \u201cit was clearly a foreboding sign, but I didn\u2019t know what to make of it.\u201d Despite the apparent clash of sensibilities, Amanat liked the idea of joining forces with a deep-pocketed investor  he expected Doronin to play a passive role.<\/p>\n<p>The two Aman junkies apparently craved their objective so intensely that they made only cursory attempts to vet each other. On Dec. 25, just two weeks after they were introduced, Amanat and Doronin sealed their alliance with a 13-page agreement outlining their plan to buy Aman.<\/p>\n<p>Both Amanat and Doronin felt pressure to move quickly. Once they put down their $30 million deposit, they had 30 days to close the deal. Other bidders were waiting. Meanwhile, according to a Doronin attorney, other investors fell through, and the billionaire increased the amount he planned to put in several times. As he upped the number, he decided he would play a more active role in Aman. By the time they finalized the $358 million purchase on Feb. 7, Doronin had proffered cash and a loan for 64%  Amanat, Zecha, and several other investors had committed to the other 36%.<\/p>\n<p>Less than nine weeks had elapsed between Doronin and Amanat\u2019s first meeting and the sale. It would take even less time than that for the relationship to sour.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline \"><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px color:red text-decoration:underline \">5. The Unraveling<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nBefore the deal even closed, red flags began appearing. Doronin noticed something curious. He had paid $20 million of the $30 million deposit to hold the deal while the final particulars were negotiated. He expected Amanat to pay the remainder. But according to Doronin\u2019s legal filings, a statement he received in early January revealed that Zecha had contributed the other $10 million. Amanat had provided no cash. In Doronin\u2019s view, the man who had instigated the deal faced no financial risk if it fell apart.<\/p>\n<p>Amanat offered shifting explanations to <em>Fortune<\/em> on this point. He first stated that the value of the deal was fluctuating and that the deposit might be increased. (Saurabh Chawla, DLF\u2019s executive vice president of finance, says the deposit amount \u201cnever changed.\u201d) Later one of Amanat\u2019s press representatives asserted that Amanat thought another investor might enter and pay part of the deposit.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, Doronin was getting nervous about his partner. But he had put down a lot of money, and he didn\u2019t want to back out. Amanat claims that around January and February, Doronin threatened to scuttle the deal. Because of that, Amanat says in his court filings, he acceded to a list of demands from Doronin, including giving up one of his board seats. Amanat also claims that Doronin frisked him before a board meeting in Miami to see if he was wearing a recording device. (A Doronin spokesperson denies that the billionaire threatened to scotch the deal and says Amanat volunteered to give up control as long as Doronin didn\u2019t dilute his stake. The spokesperson says Doronin never frisked Amanat.)<\/p>\n<p>Even as that relationship crumbled, Amanat went looking for another backer\u2014only to see the new alliance shatter equally fast. Amanat was introduced to Johan Eliasch, chairman and CEO of Head. A former deputy treasurer of Britain\u2019s Conservative Party, Eliasch is prominent in political and business circles in London, as well as in Europe\u2019s jet set. He once dated Sharon Stone and is friends with Prince Andrew.<\/p>\n<p>Eliasch invested $25 million for a 14% stake in Aman and a board seat and loaned the company an additional $25 million. Amanat says he was flabbergasted to discover, soon after, that Eliasch was friends with Doronin. Amanat accuses him of concealing the relationship. (Eliasch, in a letter cited in the litigation, denies being in cahoots with anyone.)<\/p>\n<p>Once on the board, Amanat contends, Eliasch aligned himself with Doronin, and the pair prepared to set a coup in motion. By April the battle had escalated to a full-on war.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline \"><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px color:red text-decoration:underline \">6. The Founder resigns\u2014or does he?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nZecha was growing increasingly troubled, according to his witness statement, over the rancor between his partner Amanat and Doronin. He was keenly aware that if the pair did not reach a quick rapprochement, Aman\u2019s image and business would suffer. He held a private dinner with Doronin and Eliasch on April 21, the night before a scheduled board meeting. Zecha hoped he could broker some kind of peace between the two and Amanat.<\/p>\n<p>During the dinner, at Doronin\u2019s mansion in Star Island, Miami, Zecha told the men that he would be compelled to resign if the factions could not cooperate. The following day, at the end of a marathon 10-hour board meeting at the law offices of Greenberg Traurig in Miami, a frustrated Zecha followed through on his threat and told the group he was abdicating his roles as CEO and chairman.<\/p>\n<p>Doronin took over as chief executive, with Eliasch becoming chairman. But the seemingly straightforward handoff instantly turned bizarre and contentious. Zecha, whose tenure was already set to end on July 31 under the terms of the sale, insisted that his resignation was not intended to be immediate and was contingent upon several conditions, including the fate of several of his longtime executives. Zecha\u2019s witness statement in the London litigation asserts that he was intimidated into leaving. He says he was presented with a three-page notice of resignation and asked to sign it\u2014while still at the board meeting\u2014which left him \u201cshocked and bewildered.\u201d (Doronin\u2019s filings contend that Zecha\u2019s resignation was purely voluntary.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/toc22_1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-780737\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/toc22_1.jpg?w=1024 038 h=829\" alt=\"Amanyara, Aman Resorts\" width=\"1024\" height=\"829\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Amanyara Resort in Turks and Caicos<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Lisa Romerein\u2014Otto<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The mood inside Aman\u2019s Singapore headquarters darkened. On April 30, Zecha\u2019s statement charges, he was prevented from entering his office. Two weeks later he was given three days to agree to vacate his home\u2014whose lease belongs to Aman\u2014where his family had lived for the previous 15 years. (\u201cThis is categorically untrue,\u201d says a Doronin spokesperson, who states that \u201cMr. Zecha and his son continue to live in their luxurious homes.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>Aman was now divided into two warring factions: one led by the newly appointed CEO and chairman, a second led by Amanat and the founder. Each side claimed legitimacy. Directives were issued from one side, according to an employee, only to be invalidated by the other. \u201cWe\u2019re caught in the line of fire,\u201d says this source. Numerous employees were abruptly let go.<\/p>\n<p>Guests were still enjoying the resorts, but managers winced at the bad press. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sensitive situation,\u201d says one resort owner. \u201cI don\u2019t want the Aman name to be given the wrong exposure.\u201d Meanwhile Aman junkies fretted about Zecha\u2019s departure. Would the chain be overdeveloped, with cookie-cutter properties, and then flipped?<\/p>\n<p>The combat between the Amanat and Doronin factions intensified. The two sides pounded each other with almost cartoonish accusations, reflected in their court papers:<\/p>\n<p><em>Pow!<\/em> Amanat claimed that Doronin fired employees and made decisions without board approval.<\/p>\n<p><em>Slam!<\/em> Doronin charged it was Amanat and Zecha who intimidated staffers, blocked emails, and changed the door locks.<\/p>\n<p><em>Boom!<\/em> Amanat alleged that Doronin used Aman to help his friends, donating Aman vacations to a Leonardo DiCaprio charity auction and setting up Doronin\u2019s model girlfriend as the \u201cface of Aman.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Bam!<\/em> Doronin contended Amanat and Zecha made unilateral decisions without board approval, such as creating an advisory board with former FBI director Louis Freeh on it.<\/p>\n<p>It was a dizzying array of beefs and allegations. The only constant was the accused\u2019s insistence on his innocence\u2014and that the other party should be expelled.<\/p>\n<p>In July, Amanat and Zecha took the battle to court. Three interim hearings were held before three judges to rule on motions for a series of temporary injunctions. On Sept. 15, the parties were scheduled to return to court, in part so a judge could decide whether a full trial will be held in December.<\/p>\n<p>The first ruling was a victory for team Amanat. On July 14, the High Court provisionally found a \u201cclear breach of contract\u201d in Zecha\u2019s removal before his tenure expired on July 31. The judge also found that \u201cMr. Doronin has no proper basis for calling himself CEO as matters stand,\u201d rebuking him for \u201cneedlessly and inappropriately aggressive conduct\u201d in locking Zecha out of his office and removing him from his house. The triumph, however, was limited, as it returned Zecha to his roles for only 17 days. Olivier Jolivet, a longtime Aman executive and Zecha prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was named interim CEO. Doronin approved the choice. (There was a modicum of good news for the billionaire too: The High Court rejected Amanat\u2019s attempt to have Eliasch removed from the board.)<\/p>\n<p>Reached on July 29, two days before his tenure as CEO was to expire, Zecha told Fortune he didn\u2019t want to speak, then blurted out, \u201cI\u2019m holding the fort. I\u2019m responsible to 5,000 people all over the bloody place that made Aman what it is today.\u201d He declined to discuss the lawsuit but noted that Doronin was \u201cOmar\u2019s partner, not mine.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline \"><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px color:red text-decoration:underline \">7. A \u201cSerial Swindler\u201d?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nOn July 16, Doronin filed suit against Amanat in New York state court. The suit labels him a \u201cserial swindler\u201d and alleges that he fraudulently misrepresented his finances. It claims that Amanat surreptitiously used Doronin\u2019s money to pay millions of Amanat\u2019s obligations on the Aman deal. Amanat\u2019s conduct, according to the filing, was part of a long-standing pattern.<\/p>\n<p>To hear Doronin tell it, Amanat\u2019s finances were a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. Even something as basic as a verification of credit turned into a gothic mystery. The billionaire charged that Amanat forged a crucial document that vouched for the assets in his investment fund. That document, according to Doronin\u2019s filings, was \u201ca fraud on fabricated letterhead, with a forged signature.\u201d Amanat had provided a letter from a British brokerage firm, Fyshe Horton Finney, certifying that his investment entity had more than $140 million in its account. However, upon investigation (<em>after<\/em> the deal), Doronin\u2019s legal papers asserted that Fyshe Horton was in the British equivalent of bankruptcy proceedings at the time of the letter and that its client assets had been transferred to another institution. Moreover, the letter had a logo for Fyshe Horton on it but was signed by Tom Evans, the CEO of a different entity called FHF Securities. The letter claimed that FHF had possession of Amanat\u2019s assets. But according to Doronin\u2019s filings, FHF was not registered or authorized to hold funds during this period.<\/p>\n<p>Evans turned out to be a tricky person to reach. Fortune\u2019s attempts to contact him resulted in\u2026an email from an Amanat representative purporting to confirm Evans\u2019s earlier statements. A call to the phone number listed on that email and on Evans\u2019s letter landed in the offices of a U.K. solicitor  the person who answered said she hadn\u2019t heard of FHF Securities or Tom Evans. After a series of additional emails, a person identifying himself as Evans called <em>Fortune<\/em>. He explained that FHF is a holding company that has several of the old Fyshe Horton Finney assets, Amanat\u2019s among them. He stated, \u201cThe funds Mr. Amanat had with us in a trading account were in excess of $250 million.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sal Strazzullo, one of Amanat\u2019s attorneys, contends that the London hearings have already settled any question of fraud. \u201cWith all due respect to Vlad,\u201d he says, \u201cMr. Amanat has not done anything wrong. He mixed himself up with a bully that thinks he can strong-arm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the further Doronin\u2019s investigators probed, their filings claim, the more disturbing the discoveries: multiple instances, for example, in which Amanat overstated his roles in deals, some of which raise questions about the extent of Amanat\u2019s assets. And Doronin reported a litany of not merely past lawsuits against Amanat\u2014some filed by former business partners who claimed he misled them\u2014but also a number of judgments against him.<\/p>\n<p>Worse, in 2008 the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) permanently barred Amanat \u201cfrom associating with any FINRA member firm in any capacity\u201d because he \u201cwillfully and repeatedly\u201d failed to disclose legal judgments and the existence of a past SEC investigation. (A spokesperson for Amanat says he was living in Europe at the time of the FINRA proceedings and \u201cdid not receive the relevant correspondence,\u201d which led to a default ruling.)<\/p>\n<p>Strangest of all, perhaps, Doronin\u2019s suit noted that Amanat\u2014the millionaire with the string of apparent successes\u2014had actually been mired in bankruptcy for the better part of the past decade.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline \"><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px color:red text-decoration:underline \">8. The Chauffeur and the bankruptcy<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nHow did Omar Amanat come to find himself in the distressing straits of personal bankruptcy? Let\u2019s allow Allan Gropper, the judge who oversaw the Chapter 7 proceeding, to explain, as he did in a 2012 hearing: \u201cYou might certainly be interested in reading how Mr. Amanat started off his Chapter 7 case, which was absolutely extraordinary. He induced his chauffeur to file an involuntary petition against him on the theory that, well, in an involuntary [bankruptcy] he could get an automatic stay against a number of creditors who are going against him, but it wouldn\u2019t stop him from engaging in whatever transactions he wanted to\u2026I made no finding there that he had perjured himself\u2026on the first occasion that he appeared before this court. So I\u2019m not saying I make any such finding now, but you can draw your own conclusions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To understand how Amanat came to be in bankruptcy, you have to go back to the 2002 deal in which he sold Tradescape to E*Trade. As noted, E*Trade bought Amanat\u2019s company for $100 million worth of E*Trade stock, along with an additional $180 million if Tradescape achieved certain milestones. That\u2019s fairly unremarkable.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s remarkable is how quickly the transaction melted down. The merger closed on June 10, 2002, and as part of the agreement, Amanat stayed on with E*Trade. A mere six weeks later, according to his own legal filings, he was called unexpectedly into a conference room, where a group of E*Trade executives and attorneys confronted him and fired him on the spot.<\/p>\n<p>E*Trade and Amanat later traded lawsuits. E*Trade accused Amanat of concealing the fact that Tradescape was hemorrhaging money and near collapse when Amanat sold it to E*Trade. According to the suit, one executive emailed Amanat before the deal and said, \u201cWe have no money!!!! Zero. Zilch. Nada\u2026We can\u2019t pay any of our bills.\u201d For his part, Amanat claimed that E*Trade had intentionally sabotaged its own acquisition and committed fraud, in part by not disclosing that it paid its then CEO $90 million in a single year. Amanat\u2019s suit also claimed that an investor had threatened the lives of Amanat and his family. (An Amanat spokesperson says Tradescape was \u201chighly successful\u201d and contends that it failed because of a rapid decline in E*Trade stock, which left Tradescape unable to pay a series of employee bonuses.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ama22_11.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-780735\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ama22_11.jpg?w=900 038 h=600\" alt=\"Aman Resorts, Amanusa\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">The Amanusa Resort in Bali<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Frederic Lagrange\u2014Otto<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Those events led to two bankruptcies in 2004, one for Amanat\u2019s company MarketXT and one for Amanat himself. They generated a multiyear profusion of hearings, motions, rulings, and at least one appeal. After many detours the court entered a $24.3 million judgment against Amanat, and a final settlement was reached in 2012. Amanat himself asserts that he has paid his settlement. But Lester Kirshenbaum, lead attorney for the creditors, disputes that  he says Amanat has yet to finish paying it off. (E*Trade and Amanat dropped their suits against each other. E*Trade ultimately released $40 million in shares it had held in escrow to the bankruptcy estate of MarketXT.)<\/p>\n<p>Before the case was over, the bankruptcy judge, Gropper, found that Amanat executed fraudulent conveyances, deceived creditors, and backdated documents. For example, in the spring of 2004 a former investor in Tradescape who had won a $6.7 million judgment against Amanat attempted to take legal possession of a house Amanat owned in Queens. He discovered that Amanat had just sold the house to his brother for $10, with the sale document, notarized by Amanat\u2019s mother, listing the date of sale as August 2003. Amanat protested his innocence, but ultimately the court nullified the transfer to his brother, and the bankruptcy trustee sold the house\u2014for $ 0,000\u2014to pay Amanat\u2019s debts.<\/p>\n<p>In a separate state case, an appeals court upheld a ruling that Amanat had refused, in a \u201cwillful and contumacious\u201d manner, to comply with six court orders to produce documents. A spokesperson denies Amanat engaged in fraudulent behavior or ignored discovery requests and says he \u201cstrongly disagreed with the judge\u2019s conclusions in this case.\u201d As for the house transfer, the spokesperson says, \u201cUnder normal conditions individuals are allowed to transfer anything to anyone for some or no consideration. We could not predict the bankruptcy filings that occurred a year later, and transactions such as this are unfortunately routinely unwound during bankruptcy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The trustee\u2019s final account in Amanat\u2019s personal bankruptcy stated that $209 million in claims had been \u201casserted\u201d against Amanat, of which $  million were \u201callowed.\u201d Of that figure, $658,350 was distributed to claimants, with another $1.4 million used to pay administrative costs.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline \"><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px padding-bottom:15px color:red text-decoration:underline \">9. \u201cNot intended to be a commitment\u201d<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nThe Doronin litigation is not the only legal challenge Amanat faces from the Aman acquisition. A second suit alleges that, even as he courted Doronin in late 2013, Amanat was apparently talking to another firm that was going to help him raise capital: Amanat allegedly agreed to an exclusive agreement with New York\u2019s Vinland Capital Investments to raise money for the Aman acquisition. Amanat later spurned Vinland, which is now suing him for breach of contract. Amanat\u2019s filings contend the claims should be dismissed because, among other reasons, \u201che did not execute the Dec. 13, 2013, agreement in his personal capacity and thus was not a party to the operative agreement.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Amanat provided a number of documents to <em>Fortune<\/em> to back his assertion that he had several financing commitments before he met Doronin. None of the papers could be independently verified, and many were marked \u201cnot intended to be a commitment.\u201d None had signatures. Amanat also provided a financial statement with no bank name or logo on it. He repeatedly promised to provide recordings of Doronin threatening him, but never did.<\/p>\n<p>Amanat says he is standing his ground. He has a history of fighting back. Three years ago he sued four publications in Britain, where libel laws favor plaintiffs, after they called him an \u201cimposter\u201d for overstating his relationship to the Summit movie studio. The publications ultimately retracted the articles, apologized, made charitable donations in his name, and paid his legal fees. (A search of legal filings shows no sign that Amanat sued the U.S. website that first revealed a letter written by a Summit lawyer to Amanat. That letter accused him of inflating his connection to the studio. Amanat\u2019s lawyer at the time described the claims as \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cdefamatory.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>Amanat insists Doronin is just maneuvering for position while he himself is motivated by principle. \u201cThis is about doing the right thing,\u201d he says. \u201cGet the story right. I didn\u2019t want to get in a battle with a Russian oligarch. I realized that I needed to do the right thing by the brand, by Adrian and the customers. Otherwise, I could take the money and run.

Most of them work for nearby tech companies like Palantir Technologies, SurveyMonkey, and MongoDB\u2014some of the hottest startups in the area. It\u2019s hard to tell by their uniform of T-shirts, hoodies, and jeans, but it\u2019s likely that this group of twenty- and thirtysomethings contains a sample of the most sought-after young professionals in the country. Above them, to the right of the door, is a sign that says PHILZ COFFEE: NOW HIRING ROCK STAR TALENT.<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to Silicon Valley, where employees (yes, that includes baristas at Philz) are not just employees\u2014they\u2019re rock stars. This is the land of luxurious perks (think massages, onsite haircuts, and free food) and high starting salaries. It\u2019s also a place where entrepreneurial dreams take flight\u2014there\u2019s always the potential, however slim the odds, of getting rich quick by working for a startup with a successful \u201cexit.\u201d And it\u2019s not just the money and benefits that attract the rock stars. Out here young people feel they can make an impact\u2014a.k.a. change the way the world shops, banks, gets around, and accesses health care\u2014one algorithm at a time, which many young people value more than job security. As venture capitalist Marc Andreessen recently wrote in his blog, \u201cSilicon Valley isn\u2019t just a place\u2014it\u2019s a state of mind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Silicon Valley companies compete tooth and nail for top talent, but they\u2019ve had an advantage, since the Bay Area has become a mecca for some of the country\u2019s best and brightest. For years, graduates of elite universities like Harvard, Yale, and Cornell who once dreamed of working on Wall Street have flocked to the Valley, a trend that is only growing. Case in point: The percentage of Harvard Business School graduates who opted for jobs in the tech sector rose from 12% in 2012 to 18% in 2013, while the number of students who decided to start a career in finance dropped from 35% to 27%. And while once-scrappy Google, one of the jewels in Silicon Valley\u2019s crown, recently celebrated its 10-year anniversary as a public company, it remains a top choice among graduates. According to a recent survey from research firm Universum Global, engineering and business school students consistently rank Google as the company they most want to work for.<\/p>\n<p>To compete, top banks like Goldman Sachs reportedly have upped their starting salaries and bonuses for interns. Other industries, like manufacturing and transportation, are also trying to find ways to attract young employees, especially as new skill sets like coding, creativity, and collaboration become increasingly important in a more global, digital, and fast-moving world. And that talent crunch only increases as more and more baby boomers exit the workforce. (According to the U.S. Census Bureau, by 2030 more than 20% of Americans are projected to be age 65 and over, compared with just 13% in 2010.) \u201cCEOs are just doing the math,\u201d says China Gorman, CEO of Great Place to Work, a San Francisco\u2013based human resources consulting and research firm. \u201cBaby boomers are leaving, and there aren\u2019t enough people coming in to fill their jobs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s at stake? As market shifts and rapidly changing technologies transform businesses, companies that don\u2019t have up-to-date, evolving skill sets will fall behind. Hiring and retaining younger employees are more important than ever. \u201cCompanies that are able to hire, develop, and motivate the best people will have an obvious advantage,\u201d says Claudio Fern\u00e1ndez-Ar\u00e1oz, a senior adviser at global executive search firm Egon Zehnder.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, attracting a new generation takes more than beanbags and Ping-Pong tables (not to mention stock options). It can require a deeper shift in culture, including a more transparent leadership team and a constant effort to communicate values to current and prospective employees. And that\u2014in addition to robust internship programs and other recruiting tools\u2014is something Silicon Valley companies have gotten right.<\/p>\n<p>Ironically, while the dearth of skilled talent will get only worse, across-the-board unemployment remains relatively high. \u201cThe paradox is profound,\u201d says a recent report on global talent from Oxford Economics, an economic forecasting firm. \u201cOn the one hand, 40 million workers in the industrialized world are unemployed\u2026Yet executives and managers tasked with hiring new workers often say they are unable to find the right people with the proper skills to fill their vacancies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Silicon Valley is also feeling the talent crunch. Ask any technology CEO what his or her biggest challenge is, and the answer will probably be finding and hiring talent. (That\u2019s at least partly why the latest \u201ctrend\u201d in the Valley is doing more outreach to prospective female and minority employees, not to mention hiring developers without the usual credentials.) And yet there\u2019s a lot to be learned from them. Because if there\u2019s one thing the tech sector gets, it\u2019s that people\u2014more than any other resource\u2014are a company\u2019s most valuable asset.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/tal.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-780626\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/tal.jpg?w=550 038 h=314\" alt=\"The Global Talent Crunch Over the next decade, it is estimated that the growth in demand for college-educated talent will exceed the growth in supply for most developed world.

She graduated from the HEC School of Management, one of the top business schools in Paris, back in 2002, and later made her way to the Bay Area. After a stint in the Napa Valley wine industry, Setton got into Stanford University\u2019s MBA program, during which she landed a product-marketing internship at Apple.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI did the internship there because I wanted to work for the top American technology company,\u201d says Setton, 35. One day she bumped into then-CEO Steve Jobs in an elevator at the Apple campus in Cupertino. The commanding chief executive officer stood right by Setton, who knew she had about 10 seconds to say something before he stepped out.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI told him I was an intern and would soon be going to China to work on the Beijing Olympics campaign,\u201d says Setton (the year was 2007). \u201cHe turned around and said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re sending interns to China.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of how Jobs might have felt about giving interns such responsibilities, in Setton\u2019s case the experience was invaluable. She later went to work for a startup in the energy field, because, she says, \u201cI found energy and the environment to be something I really believed in.\u201d After a few years she switched to the networking site LinkedIn. \u201cIt was a company that had a strong mission and strong brand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After about a year and a half working as a global sales manager for LinkedIn, Setton made another career move, accepting an offer to become a senior director at enterprise-software maker Medallia, based in Palo Alto.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt always starts with alignment with the vision,\u201d Setton says of her career moves. \u201cIt\u2019s about having an impact and changing the world. My changes were always driven by companies whose mission I felt socially aligned with.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Setton\u2019s career trajectory is a perfect example of several new phenomena in today\u2019s workforce. Her flexibility to switch between jobs and industries might make some employers see her as disloyal (a common complaint about millennials), but that chameleon-like ability to change every few years also means she can adopt new skills as her employers adapt to a rapidly changing, increasingly technology-driven and global corporate world. (Jobs didn\u2019t know it, but one of the reasons Apple sent her to Beijing is that Setton studied Mandarin.)<\/p>\n<p>At LinkedIn, one of Setton\u2019s former employers, the acknowledgment that employees won\u2019t stay with the company forever starts before they even join and isn\u2019t perceived as a negative. Kevin Scott, senior vice president of engineering at the company, based in Mountain View, asks an important question of every candidate he interviews: \u201cWhat job do you want after you work at LinkedIn?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPart of the reason Silicon Valley companies are so successful is that they\u2019re a recombination of people who have worked in multiple companies,\u201d says Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and co-author of a new book called <em>The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHistorically, most companies don\u2019t want to ask that question,\u201d says Ben Casnocha, an entrepreneur who co-authored the book with Hoffman. \u201cBut today your best people are not going to be lifers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For Setton, the pace of change and acquiring new skills come naturally\u2014both in her personal and professional world. So does the need to believe in what her employer of choice does in the world.<\/p>\n<p>That is something many tech companies got early on, perhaps because they were started by young people with aspirations similar to those of the employees they\u2019re hiring. Google\u2019s idealistic corporate slogan has always been \u201cDon\u2019t be evil.\u201d Facebook\u2019s mission is to \u201cmake the world more open and connected.\u201d Twitter\u2019s? To give everyone the \u201cpower to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.\u201d Even Philz Coffee has a mission: \u201cTo better people\u2019s day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A recent article by Ravin Jesuthasan, global head of talent management at consulting firm Towers Watson, advises insurance companies on new means of attracting skilled workers. \u201cOne way insurers can attract workers is by underscoring the positive role risk management plays in modern society\u2014the good it can actually do for individuals, groups, companies, even countries,\u201d writes Jesuthasan.<\/p>\n<p>Having a mission that resonates not just with customers but with employees can go a long way toward attracting younger workers, and not just in technology or insurance. Whole Foods Market, for example, has also been able to attract top talent, not only because of its higher-than-average wages and stock options, but also because it has a compelling mission statement: \u201cOur vision reaches beyond food retailing. In fact, our deepest purpose as an organization is helping support the health, well-being, and healing of both people\u2014customers, team members, and business organizations in general\u2014and the planet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Of course, while having an effectively communicated higher purpose is key to getting prospective employees\u2019 attention, actually getting young workers in the door requires a bit more work.<\/p>\n<p>Tech companies compete fiercely to recruit on college campuses and at job fairs. And increasingly, like Square, they are turning to high schoolers to fill the talent gap. Facebook now recruits teen interns before their freshman year of college, and LinkedIn, which has hired 300 interns this year alone, has opened its summer program to high school students. Airbnb, meanwhile, has brought in interns as young as 16.<\/p>\n<p>In the Valley interns are usually expected to write code, come up with ideas, and produce work just as any other employee would. \u201cInterns are very important\u2014they really are our lifeblood,\u201d says Miranda Kalinowski, head of global recruiting at Facebook. \u201cThey do actual work\u2014things that help us become more open and connected.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some tech companies outside the Valley get the need to expand too, and are opening internship programs to military veterans. Charles Phillips, CEO of the New York\u2013based enterprise-software maker Infor, plans to hire close to 100 interns this year and says some of those spots will be reserved for veterans. He also says he is open to recruiting developers and designers who don\u2019t have college degrees. Phillips, a former Marine, says, \u201cThere are plenty of talented people who didn\u2019t go to school.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In fact, if or where candidates went to college isn\u2019t necessarily indicative of how successful they will be within a company, says Vivienne Ming, VP of research and insight at Gild, a San Francisco\u2013based startup that applies big-data tools to finding and placing developers. An increasing number of tech companies now sell \u201cpeople analytics\u201d tools for use in hiring.<\/p>\n<p>Expanding the pool of candidates also means accommodating employees who would have normally opted for working independently or outside the office. That\u2019s why Santa Clara\u2013based Intel, an older tech company, is experimenting with different work arrangements for entrepreneurial employees or those who want to spend more time with family.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe workforce of today is very different from the workforce of a decade ago,\u201d says Zahir Ladhani, VP of IBM\u2019s Smarter Workforce division, which makes HR analytics tools. \u201cEmployees expect greater flexibility.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Outreach and hiring are challenges, but so is retention. That\u2019s partly why, once an intern\u2014or any employee\u2014has been hired, many Silicon Valley companies require weeks-long training. Facebook, whose engineering boot camp is a six-week program for new hires to learn its code base and culture, has created boot camps for other types of employees\u2014from data scientists to sales and marketing. Apple University, set up in 2008 by Jobs, indoctrinates new employees to Apple\u2019s approach to product design and other cultural elements. It\u2019s also a way for Apple to integrate new employees after acquisitions, like the recent $3 billion purchase of headphone company Beats.<\/p>\n<p>Not every company will be able to emulate Google\u2014or Facebook or Square or Twitter, for that matter. Nor should it. But CEOs who are able to come up with their own twist on \u201cGoogleyness\u201d\u2014whether through internships, training programs, flexible hiring processes, or transparency with employees\u2014will probably have an easier time attracting rock stars.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story is from the September 22, 2014 issue of Fortune.<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 4, 2014","published":"2014-09-04 07:06:56","updated":"2014-09-04 07:06:56","minute":"7:06 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/the-global-talent-crunch\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/the-global-talent-crunch\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/tal22_2.jpg?w=407","class":"featured-img-article_portrait","credit":"Illustration by Matt Murphy for Fortune Magazine","caption":"","attach_id":"780501"},"short_title":"The global talent crunch","excerpt":"<p>The coming labor shortage is being fought head-on by a new generation of talent innovators\u2014Silicon Valley<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"462401","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/michal-lev-ram\/","name":"Michal Lev-Ram","twitter":"mlevram","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"55\" height=\"55\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/michal_lev_ram.jpg?w=55\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"MICHAL LEV-RAM\" \/>","bio":"","title":"","company":""}],"sections":[{"term_id":829614,"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46728,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News, analysis, and insight into technology and business, including Silicon Valley giants like Apple, Google, Facebook, and our annual Brainstorm Tech conference.","parent":0,"count":12906,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/category\/tech\/"},"tags":[{"term_id":7885,"name":"Leadership","slug":"leadership","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":47173,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":202,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":361061,"name":"Management Strategy","slug":"management-strategy","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":109645,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":51,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":49875,"name":"Silicon Valley","slug":"silicon-valley","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":57825,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":54,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":196406,"name":"talent management","slug":"talent-management","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":115467,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":2,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":67883,"name":"Talent retention","slug":"talent-retention","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":113820,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":2,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":271519527,"name":"Where the Talent Is","slug":"where-the-talent-is","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":115831,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":3,"filter":"raw"}],"primary_tag":{"name":"Where the Talent Is","slug":"where-the-talent-is","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/where-the-talent-is\/"},"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"The coming labor shortage is being fought head-on by a new generation of talent innovators\u2014Silicon Valley","seo":{"seo_title":"The global talent crunch","seo_description":"The coming labor shortage is being fought head-on by a new generation of talent innovators\u2014Silicon Valley","seo_keywords":"leadership, management strategy, silicon valley, talent management, talent retention","seo_news_keywords":"leadership, management strategy, silicon valley, talent management, talent retention","seo_additional_meta":""},"social":{"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2014%2F09%2F04%2Fthe-global-talent-crunch%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F1lGbE1f","encoded_title":"The+global+talent%C2%A0crunch","twitter_text":"The global talent\u00a0crunch","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"The coming labor shortage is being fought head-on by a new generation of talent innovators\u2014Silicon Valley","facebook_title":"The global talent crunch"},"format":{"term_id":2710,"name":"Article","slug":"fortune-post-format-article","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"fortune_post_format","description":"","parent":0,"count":6144,"filter":"raw"},"related_posts":[]},{"id":778634,"url":"\/2014\/09\/04\/how-google-works\/","title":"How Google works","content":"<p>Even 10 years after going public, Google remains the most sought-after workplace in the world\u2014period. It sits atop <em>Fortune\u2019s<\/em> list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For and fields more than 2 million job applications every year.<\/p>\n<p>In <em>How Google Works<\/em>, a new book to be published later this month, chairman Eric Schmidt and exec adviser Jonathan Rosenberg pull back the curtain to reveal how the company created its unique culture of workplace innovation. They recently spoke to <em>Fortune<\/em> about hiring practices, talent, and Googleyness. Here are some highlights from that conversation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has Google been able to sustain its culture even while growing apace? <\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Schmidt:<\/strong> I think one way to understand Google is to understand that we built it to systematize innovation. If you have a way in which new stuff keeps happening, then the culture evolves with that. You don   t say \u201cwe   re going to preserve our culture.\u201d Instead you build an innovation culture that will take care of itself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rosenberg:<\/strong> We talk a lot in the book about setting the principles of culture from the outset. And I think we   ve continued to maintain those as cultural guideposts with all of the people we   ve hired since the IPO.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What specifically has changed in 10 years? <\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Rosenberg:<\/strong> The implementation of the principles are much harder when you get bigger. But we   re still espousing and living the same principles. You just have to repeat the prayer more times and in more places.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What   s the worst job interview you   ve ever been on? <\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Rosenberg:<\/strong> I certainly remember when the Procter &amp  Gamble people came to recruit at the University of Chicago. They were looking for people who were very quantitative and had strong statistics backgrounds and they were trying to hire me as a product manager. The guy   s pitch was that driving forward at P&amp G was like looking through your rear view mirror. So the idea that P&amp G was not really empowering the product managers to think forward, but simply to look backwards at data and try to figure out what to do with the pricing and the couponing of the services. That was my worst one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you identify great talent?<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Rosenberg :<\/strong> The No. 1 thing that you look for is passion. You want the kind of person who is constantly learning. Ask them to reveal the surprises that they saw in the things that they worked on because it shows you their thinking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Schmidt:<\/strong> Most companies hire for the position, not the person. So they look for a match on LinkedIn for all of the criteria: They have to have five years of this, and 10 years of that\u2014and that\u2019s precisely the wrong way to go about hiring. The right way is to hire the smartest people that you can, because the business is changing. So what you care about is their critical thinking. You want leaders who will keep fighting and keep changing the strategy, changing their tactics so they\u2019ll eventually win.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What happens when a Googler starts losing the passion?<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Schmidt:<\/strong> Hopefully it starts with a conversation initiated by the employee or by you. In that conversation you basically ask them, \u201cWhere do you see yourself in five years? What excites you?\u201d It\u2019s a specific kind of person who wants to work in an environment that is always changing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rosenberg:<\/strong> If somebody has actually lost the passion for attacking big problems and changing the world, there\u2019s not much I can do as a manager to fix that. What we have always done pretty aggressively is rotate our passionate people across the company into different organizations. We talk about that in the book\u2014pass the M&amp M\u2019s and not the raisins.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So where do you see yourself in five years?<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Rosenberg:<\/strong> Wow. I think at this point I don\u2019t expect to be a in full-time operational role, so the ideal job for me over the course of the next several years is to try to help small teams at Google learn and understand the principles that we espouse in this book.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Schmidt:<\/strong> For me, I made a decision that Google is my home. I was CEO for a decade. My plan is to be chairman for a long time. You want to do multiple jobs in life. I\u2019ve been working on innovation and technology policy\u2014in a long tradition of scientists helping government to do the right thing. So that\u2019s where I\u2019ve ended up, and I\u2019m quite happy with that. And I think that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be for a long time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Any advice for job seekers?<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Schmidt:<\/strong> The primary thing you should do as a potential employee is figure out which is the most fun fast-growing company and go work there, because something is going to happen. Either you   ll get promoted three times. That   s what happened to me when I was at Sun [Microsystems]. I had no confidence, but I was promoted every year. (laughs) They needed someone to do this stuff and I was there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You say you look for candidates who exhibit Googleyness. What is that? <\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Rosenberg:<\/strong> I would go back to passion, funny, attention to detail, and the type of person who passed what Eric would call  8220 the airport test, 8221  somebody who if you were stuck somewhere, you would learn something from just by virtue of spending more time with them.<\/p>\n<p><em>Read the exclusive digital excerpt from the Talent chapter of <\/em>How Google Works<em> <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/how-google-attracts-the-worlds-best-talent\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>A shorter version of this Q&amp A appeared in the September 22, 2014 issue.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp <\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 4, 2014","published":"2014-09-04 07:09:27","updated":"2014-09-04 07:09:27","minute":"7:09 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/how-google-works\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/how-google-works\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/goo22_1-copy-copy.png?w=407","class":"featured-img-article_portrait","credit":"","caption":"Authors Jonathan Rosenberg, left, and Eric Schmidt","attach_id":"780499"},"short_title":"How Google works","excerpt":"<p>An inside look at the world   s most desired employer.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"276528","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/christopher-tkaczyk\/","name":"Christopher Tkaczyk","twitter":"ctkaczyk","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"55\" height=\"55\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/tkaczyk_headshot.jpg?w=55\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"Christopher Tkaczyk\" \/>","bio":"","title":"","company":""}],"sections":[{"term_id":4236,"name":"Management","slug":"management","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46727,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and advice on management, leadership, jobs, careers, CEOs and anyone who aspires to the C-suite.","parent":0,"count":6099,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":829614,"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46728,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News, analysis, and insight into technology and business, including Silicon Valley giants like Apple, Google, Facebook, and our annual Brainstorm Tech conference.","parent":0,"count":12905,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Management","slug":"management","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/category\/management\/"},"tags":[{"term_id":12664,"name":"Business Strategy","slug":"business-strategy","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":111037,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":24,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":81,"name":"Google","slug":"google","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46827,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":253,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":7885,"name":"Leadership","slug":"leadership","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":47173,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":202,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":361061,"name":"Management Strategy","slug":"management-strategy","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":109645,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":51,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":271519527,"name":"Where the Talent Is","slug":"where-the-talent-is","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":115831,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":3,"filter":"raw"}],"primary_tag":{"name":"Where the Talent Is","slug":"where-the-talent-is","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/where-the-talent-is\/"},"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"An inside look at the world   s most desired employer.","seo":{"seo_title":"How Google works","seo_description":"An inside look at the world's most desired employer.","seo_keywords":"","seo_news_keywords":"","seo_additional_meta":""},"social":{"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2014%2F09%2F04%2Fhow-google-works%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F1lzUu5o","encoded_title":"How+Google+works","twitter_text":"How Google works","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"An inside look at the world's most desired employer.","facebook_title":"How Google works"},"format":{"term_id":2710,"name":"Article","slug":"fortune-post-format-article","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"fortune_post_format","description":"","parent":0,"count":6144,"filter":"raw"},"related_posts":[]},{"id":778919,"url":"\/2014\/09\/03\/9-tips-to-land-your-dream-job\/","title":"9 tips to land your dream job","content":"<p>Ah, the dream job. Just as work has been reshaped by technology and globalization, so too have our professional fantasies. While jobs atop the corporate ladder haven\u2019t totally lost their luster, more and more Americans are seeking work-life balance. And now that leaner, recession-tested firms are hiring again, they\u2019re looking for something different too. Given the new landscape, we asked a few \u00adexperts\u2014\u00adcareer coaches, headhunters, and recruiters\u2014to weigh in with their best, most relevant tips for today. The old rules still \u00adapply\u2014network, network, network!\u2014but here\u2019s the latest on how to land that ideal job, whatever it may be.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">1.

That sounds like a no-brainer, but our experts say the No. 1 mistake job seekers make is not being able to articulate what kind of job they want. \u201cA lot of people will say, \u2018I\u2019m not exactly sure,\u2019 thinking they\u2019ll never get that perfection,\u201d says Patti Johnson, CEO of PeopleResults, a human-capital consulting firm that advises clients like PepsiCo, Accenture, and Microsoft. \u201cYou need to be able to describe what you want. If you can\u2019t share that, you waste people\u2019s time. If they leave without knowing how to help, forget it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">2.

You\u2019ve got to be open to whatever industry change comes your way. And recruiters will reward you for it: \u201cComfort with ambiguity\u201d is among the most sought-after qualities in job candidates today. \u201cIn the past you looked for people with a certain playbook,\u201d says Jeff Sanders, vice chairman of CEO and board practice at executive search firm Heidrick &amp  Struggles. \u201cNow you need people with relevant experience who are adaptable and quick learners.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">3.

According to our experts, more than 90% of recruiters use LinkedIn to find talented candidates, even when looking to fill top management jobs. And it influences them. Turnoffs include casual photos, sloppy writing, and incomplete or inconsistent profiles. (It should have all that\u2019s on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and then some.) Turn-ons: recommendations, thorough documentation of work accomplishments, engagement with groups, and content. Think of your profile as a place to \u201cprovide your career narrative rather than your career his-tory,\u201d says Caroline McClure, founder of ScoutRock, a talent strategy consultancy.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">4.

Recruiters, even those looking for less senior employees, are increasingly focused on intangible qualities like leadership and EQ. \u201cManagement is expecting more and more maturity at younger levels of experience,\u201d says Smooch Repovich Reynolds, an executive vice president at DHR International, an executive search firm. Don\u2019t be surprised by the personality assessments, and cultivate those skills early, says Reynolds, who adds that having meaningful conversations with colleagues is a great place to start.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">5.

Individuals who make a personal investment in staying valuable by seeking feedback, learning new skills, and thinking ahead\u2014\u201cWorry for your boss,\u201d says Paese\u2014show that potential. Present yourself as \u201ca professional in motion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">6.

Instead use platforms like Twitter genuinely\u2014to develop a professional voice and share industry-related news you\u2019re actually passionate about. Throw in some personality\u2014or put on your \u201csocial media mullet\u201d (business in the front, party in the back)\u2014and you\u2019ll really shine, says Stacy Donovan Zapar, founder of recruiting strategy firm Tenfold and the world\u2019s most connected woman on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">7.

Handwritten notes, someone who\u2019s done enough research to know he goes by Bob, not Robert, and an old-fashioned (if Google-researched) personal touch. In this game, it\u2019s quality over quantity, says Damon.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">8.

She recommends casting former bosses, peers, or executive consultants like herself to help you think through questions like \u201cHow can I enhance myself?\u201d and \u201cIs this the right time to make a move?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">9.

But early techniques, which involved genetically modified plants and outdoor cultivation, were clunky and inspired fears that food and pharmaceutical crops would cross-pollinate. Interest in the field was limited, and the drug industry pushed ahead with antibody production in a different medium, one that might strike an outsider as no less radical than tobacco: Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cells. The process, carried out in specially designed, highly regulated facilities that house the stainless-steel vats in which the CHO cells grow, is both capital-intensive and slow. But even so, making drugs in hamster and other mammalian cells has become the Big Pharma standard.<\/p>\n<p style=\"width:475px line-height:1em text-align:center border:8px color:white background-color:black padding:7px margin-left:25px \"><span style=\"font-size:24px font-weight:bold \">DARPA, the Pentagon   s quirky-ideas factory challenged tobacco  8220 pharmers 8221  to produce 10 million doses of flu vaccine in one month.

Plants used in drug manufacturing are now grown in closed, indoor facilities, often with hydroponics, which produces a more uniform crop. And plants are no longer genetically modified but simply \u201cinfiltrated\u201d\u2014submerged in solution\u2014with a modified plant virus that reprograms them to make the desired pharmaceutical protein. Once infiltrated, leaves begin producing drugs in just hours. Within days, they\u2019re harvested, ground up, and filtered, and the medicine is purified.<\/p>\n<p>While pharming can work in other plants\u2014carrot cells, for instance, are used to manufacture Elelyso, a medication for the genetic disorder Gaucher\u2019s disease and currently the only FDA-approved plant-made drug\u2014\u00adtobacco lends itself particularly well to the process. That\u2019s because it\u2019s leafy (the more biomass from which to squeeze out protein), fast growing, and thanks to tobacco companies, well understood.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/mac22_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/mac22_1.jpg?w=1024 038 h=686\" alt=\"Caliber can produce an antibody-infused tobacco plant in just weeks.  \" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" class=\"size-full wp-image-780641\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Caliber can produce an antibody-infused tobacco plant in just weeks.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo by Dan Winters for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Charles Arntzen, regents\u2019 professor at Arizona State University and a renowned expert in the realm of greenhouse meds, says antibodies manufactured in plants have proved as effective as (or more so than) those made in CHO cells. They\u2019re also quicker and cheaper to produce. A 2011 study published in the <em>Journal of Commercial Biotechnology<\/em> estimated, conservatively, that making drugs in plant cells costs just two-thirds of what it does in mammalian ones.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the pharmaceutical industry has been slow to go green. (Several big drug companies contacted by <em>Fortune<\/em> had no comment on plant-based manufacturing other than to note they don\u2019t use it.) That has left the exploration to others. Like the Pentagon. In 2009 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, launched Blue Angel, a program that challenged three tobacco pharming facilities\u2014among them, Kentucky BioProcessing and Texas-based Caliber Biotherapeutics (shown in the photo above)\u2014to produce 10 million doses of flu vaccine in one month. The reward? Tens of millions in funding.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, the process has drawn interest from nonprofits, which see its potential for addressing infectious-disease outbreaks and neglected illnesses. The Gates Foundation, for one, is working with iBio, one of the few publicly traded \u201cplantibody\u201d companies, to make low-cost vaccines for developing countries.<\/p>\n<p>As for the current West African outbreak of Ebola, pharming could perhaps offer a test case for containment. If ZMapp ultimately proves effective against the virus, experts say production could be ramped up to the necessary scale in months. And speed is critical in combating any contagion, says Maurice Moloney, who directs the agriculture, food, and health sector at Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Getting medication to people quickly, he says, \u201ccould save the world a lot of grief.\u201d\u2002<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>For more on Ebola, see our series <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/08\/22\/contagion-intro\/\" target=\"_blank\"> 8220 Contagion: How Things Spread 8221  <\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>This story is from the September 22, 2014 issue of Fortune.<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 4, 2014","published":"2014-09-04 07:20:36","updated":"2014-09-04 07:20:36","minute":"7:20 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/how-to-stop-ebola\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/how-to-stop-ebola\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/mac22_2.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photo by Dan Winters for Fortune","caption":"At its Bryan, Texas, \u00adfacility, Caliber Biotherapeutics grows more than a million plants at a time, stacked 14 layers high, using specialized infrared lights and hydroponic growing techniques.

And that figure doesn\u2019t even take into consideration the cost of the water, energy, and land used to produce food that never touches our lips.<\/p>\n<p>Doug Rauch, a former president of Trader Joe\u2019s, thinks he has a partial solution to the problem: Sell food past its \u201cbest by\u201d date. Contrary to widespread belief, such stamps are not expiration dates or markers of food safety\u2014and, with the exception of infant formula, are not federally mandated. Rather, the sell-by date is supposed to indicate the point after which the peak quality can no longer be guaranteed. Much of the time, the food remains good way past then\u2014that is, until stores throw it away. (Super\u00admarkets pull an estimated $2,300 worth of food off their shelves daily that is past its date stamp, according to Jonathan Bloom, author of the 2010 <em>American Wasteland<\/em>.)<\/p>\n<p>So this fall Rauch plans to open a store in Boston that will sell it. By procuring food from outlets like grocers, growers, and manufacturers that is past or nearing its best-by date and then turning most of it into affordable grab-and-go meals, Rauch hopes to solve two problems: food waste and a more pressing one\u2014hunger. About one in six American households don\u2019t get enough to eat, according to the USDA. Rauch, however, is going after an even bigger market: He wants to serve those who are getting enough calories, but the wrong kind (soda, snacks, etc.). And by structuring his nonprofit as a grocery store\u2014called Daily Table\u2014instead of a food bank, he hopes the model will be sustainable. \u201cWith most hunger relief, you have to qualify for services,\u201d Rauch says. \u201cThis flips it and says, \u2018I have to earn your patronage every day.\u2019\u2009\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rauch might be on to something. The European Union is considering scrapping best-before dates on items like hard cheeses and pasta\u2014a move that could reduce Europe\u2019s food \u00adwaste by 15%.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story is from the September 22, 2014 issue of Fortune.<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 4, 2014","published":"2014-09-04 07:27:49","updated":"2014-09-04 07:27:49","minute":"7:27 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/waste-not-want-not\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/waste-not-want-not\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/food-waste.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Graphic Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, Tracking North America and Oceania  all photos via Getty Images","caption":"HOUSEHOLD FOOD WASTE - Some estimates say Americans throw out 25% of the food they buy.

The space is stuffed with hunting and fishing trophies, including the mounted snout of a 726-pound marlin he landed in 1975. Express the appropriate amount of awe and Nicklaus (who today practices catch-and-release) is quick to say, \u201cThat\u2019s not that big a fish,\u201d unspooling the tale of how he landed a record 15-foot 6-inch 1,358-pounder at the Great Barrier Reef in \u201978. It took six hours to haul the fish in, and Nicklaus\u2019s right shoulder was so sore he had to keep his arm in a sling. Still hurting when the Australian Open began, Nicklaus began with a 74 but rallied to win the tournament, one of the more underrated feats of his legendary career. <\/p>\n<p>Mostly, though, his office is cluttered with family photos, with his college sweetheart, Barbara, always by his side. One group shot brings together their five children and 22 grandchildren  poignantly, the headshot of a little boy cut into the shape of a heart has been glued on. This is the Nicklauses\u2019 grandson Jake, who drowned nine years ago at 17 months of age. Nicklaus hosts an annual tournament in his honor, The Jake. This year\u2019s raised $2.2 million for the Nicklaus Children\u2019s Health Care Foundation and featured a who\u2019s who of today\u2019s pros. (He has also funded the nearby Miami Children\u2019s Hospital Nicklaus Outpatient Center, and soon a new full-service hospital\u2014for which Nicklaus has pledged to help raise $50 million\u2014will be built in his name.)<\/p>\n<p>Family, philanthropy, the great outdoors\u2014Nicklaus\u2019s passions have all been brought together in this one room. But what gets this 74-year-old living legend into the office nearly every day (often in shorts and boat shoes) is another driving force in his life: a burgeoning business empire. \u201cI have no desire to retire,\u201d says Nicklaus. \u201cI\u2019d retire to this because I enjoy it so much.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The Nicklaus Cos. is the umbrella corporation for all his business initiatives, though for most of the past four decades golf-course architecture was the primary product. Nicklaus Design has built some 380 courses in 36 countries, 290 of them dreamed up by the patriarch himself. The current fee for one of his Signature designs is upwards of $2 million. While rivals like Arnold Palmer flooded the marketplace with consumer products featuring their imprimaturs, Nicklaus preferred to dig around in the dirt, blending art and science to create his courses. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe how many endorsement deals Jack turned down through the years,\u201d says Andy O\u2019Brien, a senior vice president at the Nicklaus Cos. \u201cIt usually came back to that he preferred to build courses over everything else.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But when the economy tanked in 2008 and new golf-course construction suddenly ground to a halt, Nicklaus\u2019s fairway-centered view evolved as well. \u201cI had to think about what else I was going to do to grow the company,\u201d he says. \u201cMy objective became to find a way to create a brand that was going to last beyond my lifetime.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thus, in the past six years Nicklaus has licensed his likeness to a dizzying number of items. The distinctive Golden Bear logo can now adorn virtually every inch of your person: hats (through a partnership with AHEAD), shirts (Perry Ellis), sunglasses (PeakVision), and shoes (Allen Edmonds). You can start your day drinking Nicklaus water (Aqua Hydrate), have a Golden Bear Lemonade at lunch (Arizona), wash down dinner with a $60 Nicklaus Cabernet (Terlato), and sign your American Express bill\u2014Jack can say \u201cDon\u2019t leave home without it\u201d in Japanese\u2014with a Nicklaus pen (Curtis). All this is made possible because Nicklaus built brand equity not just by winning a record 18 major championships but also by the way he won them: with class and sportsmanship. \u201cJack Nicklaus is an emblem of the America I admired as a boy in Cuba,\u201d says George Feldenkreis, the chairman and CEO of Perry Ellis, who teamed up with the golfer in 2013 to develop an apparel line. \u201cHe\u2019s led an exemplary life. He has achieved great things, but he\u2019s devoted himself to giving back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The son of a pharmacist in Columbus, Nicklaus can still recall every inch of the 500-square-foot apartment the family lived in during his boyhood\u2014and Feldenkreis says Nicklaus brings that sensibility to the clothes that carry his name, insisting that they \u201cbe affordable to the average American, not just the shopper at Neiman Marcus.\u201d That instinct, as it happens, has turned out to be good business too: In its first year, Perry Ellis\u2019s Golden Bear\u2013embossed line racked up $50 million in sales, a number that\u2019s expected to double next year.<\/p>\n<p>An avid wine collector going back to the 1960s, Nicklaus has allowed himself to go a bit more high-end with the Napa Valley Cabernets and varietals he created with his friend Bill Terlato, CEO of Terlato Wines International. Terlato has been selling about 10,000 cases annually of its four Nicklaus labels since 2010, and it will introduce Jack\u2019s House early next year as a table wine to be priced at $20 a bottle.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a fair bet that the wine deal won\u2019t change Nicklaus\u2019s life from a financial standpoint  his net worth is in the mid-nine figures. So why do it? \u201cBecause it\u2019s fun to walk into a restaurant and order your own wine!\u201d he says. (Fittingly, Nicklaus, a connoisseur of butter pecan, is also working on an ice cream deal.) <\/p>\n<p>For all his varied enterprises, however, the one that Nicklaus remains most passionate about is the one that got him started: golf-course design. And business is picking up again. Having opened an office in Hong Kong a quarter-century ago, he was well positioned to become a dominant force in China\u2019s recent national obsession with golf. Nicklaus Design has 26 courses open for play there and 18 more under development.<\/p>\n<p>In keeping with the new business model, a smaller percentage are Signature designs as the patriarch tries harder to sell the company\u2019s services and not just himself. (His son Jackie is the president of Nicklaus Design, and numerous family members work across the enterprises, including a grandson who is a lowly assistant pro at the Bear\u2019s Club in Jupiter.) Nicklaus makes three trips a year to China in his Gulfstream IV-SP, part of a relentlessly grueling schedule. (Not long ago he did eight events in three days across three states, never going to bed before 1 a.m.)<\/p>\n<p>While his empire building shows no sign of slowing, the man himself does occasionally pause to reflect. He has received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and appeared on a five-pound note in the U.K. \u201cAll of this because I could hit a golf ball,\u201d he muses.

He wanted to see for himself how the tech would work.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an example of Scharf\u2019s hands-on approach. A 27-year banking veteran, Scharf, now 49, has been CFO of Citigroup\u2019s<span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"C\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/c\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">C<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> investment bank and held roles at Bank One before it merged with Chase, where he stayed for eight years. He took the CEO job at Visa <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"V\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/v\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">V<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> in November 2012, a no-surprise hire considering how close they are: more than 80% of Chase\u2019s credit cards are Visa, making the bank the brand\u2019s biggest issuer.<\/p>\n<p>Now Scharf is earning praise from analysts and insiders for breaking with tradition. He has made Visa, No. 238 on the Fortune 500 with $11.8 billion in revenue, more open to merchants and tech innovation. He oversees a network with 2.2 billion cards accepted by 36 million merchants globally. And he has done it with little flash: He mostly avoids press  sources describe him as \u201call-business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One year before Scharf took the reins, Dodd-Frank\u2019s Durbin Amendment of 2011 took effect, throwing payment giants and their big-bank clients for a loop. It limited debit card swipe fees, leaving merchants happier but frustrating the banks. J.P. Morgan analyst Tien-Tsin Huang says that Scharf \u201cnavigated Durbin very well. He has a tough job. He has to manage the relationships with large issuing banks, but he also needs to work with small innovators.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Scharf catered to both at once. He brokered a new 10-year deal with Chase to launch Chase Merchant Services, which runs on Visa\u2019s payment network and will lead to unique offers for merchants. The deal means increased volume of Chase credit and debit cards for Visa (which cuts into \u00adMasterCard\u2019s share). Meanwhile, he visited startup CEOs in Silicon Valley to invite open collaboration. He launched Visa Digital Solutions, which provides APIs that allow outside developers access to Visa\u2019s network as an effort to push global innovation in the industry. In July Visa released Checkout, a revamped digital wallet, making mobile purchases more seamless.<\/p>\n<p>On the hiring side, he quickly promoted Sam Shrauger, a former PayPal exec, to global head of digital. Shrauger tells Fortune that Visa, under Scharf, is a \u201cfaster\u201d company than ever before. Scharf also brought in Ryan McInerney (No. 15 on <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/40-under-40\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fortune\u2019s<\/em> 40 Under 40 in 2013<\/a>) from Chase, where he was CEO of consumer banking, to be Visa\u2019s president.<\/p>\n<p>Abroad, Scharf is overseeing a new tech development center in India, scheduled for 2015, and Visa will create 2,000 new tech jobs globally. He has pushed partnerships with mobile network operators like Vodafone <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"VOD\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/vod\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">VOD<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> in the U.K. and Telenor in Pakistan, giving customers the ability to link Visa accounts to their phones. (It is important to note that Visa Europe is a separate company, which means making Visa more global is a particularly thorny task. Because the Europe business is separate, <a title=\"How MasterCard became a tech company\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/07\/24\/mastercard-tech-company\/\">rival MasterCard<\/a> is typically considered more globally integrated, but Visa\u2019s 2013 global payment volume, the metric most indicative of market share, was $4.38 trillion to MasterCard\u2019s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MA\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/ma\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MA<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> $3 trillion.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cVisa has an excellent reputation in the market, but historically has been seen as difficult for merchants to work with,\u201d says Evercore analyst David Togut. Since Scharf became CEO, he has eliminated 50% of Visa\u2019s hefty rulebook for merchants. He keeps the original, a 1,538-page doorstop, in his office as a reminder. \u201cHe recognizes that the payments world is becoming more competitive,\u201d says Togut, \u201cand he needs to open the tent and invite everyone in\u2014merchants, disrupters, and banks. He wants to make Visa a more global brand, particularly in emerging markets. Visa is easier to do business with under Charlie Scharf.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, Scharf tells Fortune it\u2019s a new day at Visa: \u201cIt was a foreign concept inside the company to treat merchants as an equal customer to the issuers,\u201d he says. It seems the market is banking on his moves\u2014in the nearly two years since Scharf joined as CEO, Visa\u2019s stock has grown by 51%.<\/p>\n<p><em>A shorter version of this story ran in the September 22, 2014 issue of <\/em>Fortune.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 4, 2014","published":"2014-09-04 07:21:13","updated":"2014-09-04 07:21:13","minute":"7:21 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/charles-scharf-visa\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/charles-scharf-visa\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/pow22_1.jpg?w= 3","class":"featured-img-article_portrait","credit":"","caption":"Scharf at Visa\u2019s innovation center in San Francisco","attach_id":"780480"},"short_title":"Charles Scharf: Visa's open-armed leader","excerpt":"<p>Hands-on CEO Charles Scharf is extending the payment company   s reach with key partnerships.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"462344","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/daniel-roberts\/","name":"Daniel Roberts","twitter":"readDanwrite","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/9-17_fo_dan-roberts0661.jpg?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"9.17_FO_DAN ROBERTS0661\" \/>","bio":"","title":"","company":""}],"sections":[{"term_id":4269,"name":"Finance","slug":"finance","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46730,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and analysis on the business of finance, including hedge funds, markets, mergers and acquisitions, private equity, venture capital, and Wall Street.","parent":0,"count":9464,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Finance","slug":"finance","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/category\/finance\/"},"tags":[{"term_id":24441,"name":"Visa","slug":"visa","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":59569,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":253626290,"name":"Visa Digital Solutions","slug":"visa-digital-solutions","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":115568,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"}],"primary_tag":{"name":"Visa","slug":"visa","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/visa\/"},"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"Hands-on CEO Charles Scharf is extending the payment company   s reach with key partnerships.","seo":{"seo_title":"Charles Scharf: Visa's open-armed leader","seo_description":"Hands-on CEO Charles Scharf is extending the payment company's reach with key partnerships.","seo_keywords":"","seo_news_keywords":"Visa, Visa Digital Solutions","seo_additional_meta":""},"social":{"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2014%2F09%2F04%2Fcharles-scharf-visa%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F1lwHdtU","encoded_title":"Charles+Scharf%3A+Visa%E2%80%99s+open-armed%C2%A0leader","twitter_text":"Charles Scharf: Visa's open-armed\u00a0leader","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"Hands-on CEO Charles Scharf is extending the payment company's reach with key partnerships.","facebook_title":"Charles Scharf: Visa's open-armed leader"},"format":{"term_id":2710,"name":"Article","slug":"fortune-post-format-article","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"fortune_post_format","description":"","parent":0,"count":6156,"filter":"raw"},"related_posts":[]},{"id":778646,"url":"\/2014\/09\/04\/howard-ruby-the-father-of-corporate-housing\/","title":"Howard Ruby: The father of corporate housing","content":"<p><em>Searching for a gimmick after his singles-oriented California apartment complexes cooled during the 1970s, Howard Ruby conceived a completely new category: corporate housing, where companies lease apartments for extended periods for employees who are relocating or working on projects. Ruby began his business career at 5 with a lemonade stand. Today he\u2019s 79 and still CEO of Oakwood Worldwide, the world\u2019s largest corporate-housing provider, with locations in 50 states and 86 countries. Despite an eye disease, he travels with his wife, actress Yvette Mimieux, taking photographs of endangered wildlife and locations, which are often used to educate youth about climate change. Not bad for a Depression-era kid whose private company now generates annual revenues of $600 million.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I grew up in Cleveland, at the end of its industrial heyday, and visualized myself doing things others weren\u2019t. I was an entrepreneur from the age of 5\u2014running lemonade stands, delivering the newspaper, and cutting lawns\u2014and then I worked hard to go to the Wharton School of Business. Conscription was in force then, so after college I joined the Navy and was the supply officer on a destroyer that went to the Far East and traveled the world. That exposure influenced the rest of my life.<\/p>\n<p>Two months after I left the Navy, I started a real estate partnership with Bob Franks in California called R&amp B Enterprises. In 1960 we merged with a development company started by my brother Ken and Ed Broida, and became R&amp B Realty Group. The four of us each put $500 in the kitty and went on short rations, praying for a deal to happen soon  45 days later we got our first deal.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/how22_4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-780668\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/how22_4.jpg?w=1024 038 h=825\" alt=\"Howard Ruby\" width=\"1024\" height=\"825\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Ruby (left, standing) with two partners circa 1960<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo courtesy of Oakwood<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Back in the \u201960s, people were coming to California for the space program and the military, while the war built up in Vietnam. People wanted a place to meet others, so in 1965 we launched an apartment complex in Torrance called the South Bay Club. Our slogan was \u201cLive where the fun is.\u201d It was the first furnished apartments for singles, and was so successful that we went on to build thousands of units in other properties.<\/p>\n<p>We were just out of college and in our mid-twenties. We were building 150- and 250-unit buildings that required large amounts of capital. Today there\u2019s an organized venture capital industry. But back then it wasn\u2019t as easy to find investment capital. My partners and I grew mustaches to make ourselves look older and started out making presentations to groups in bridge and canasta clubs. There were a great many women who invested $5,000 to $10,000 apiece in those days. Five years later, after we were established, we\u2019d go to the banks and insurance companies, and got huge investments from them.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/how22_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-780684\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/how22_2.jpg?w=821 038 h=450\" alt=\"Oakwood\" width=\"821\" height=\"450\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">A rendering of the South Bay Club around 1965<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo Courtesy of Oakwood<\/span><\/p>\n<p>By 1970 the country was getting more serious with the Vietnam War, and there weren\u2019t as many engineers coming out to California for the space program. We had to find another audience because we had all these furnished apartments.<\/p>\n<p>We decided to try working with corporations. We changed from doing just furnished apartments to providing totally furnished apartments with household items and housekeeping. We got publicity because corporate housing was a new concept, and expanded beyond California to business centers like Texas and the District of Columbia, where there were more jobs being created. It was an instant success. Many <em>Fortune<\/em> 500 companies immediately had us take care of their needs.<\/p>\n<p>Some companies wanted temporary housing for interns with a college-dorm look. Others wanted deluxe housing for vice presidents who were relocating. We couldn\u2019t fill all the needs, so we came up with the idea of renting additional apartments from others so we could customize offerings for the various corporations.<\/p>\n<p>What makes it a good business is the breadth of opportunity. Companies have needs all over the world. Typically corporations buy temporary housing in bulk, and we have many long-term contracts. About 75% to 80% of our business is with big corporations, and 20% to 25% is with individuals who want a homey place to stay, rather than an expensive hotel, for a month while visiting family or moving to a new city.<\/p>\n<p>In the late \u201980s, we formed a new company, Oakwood Corporate Housing, to run our corporate housing operations. We continued property management under the name R&amp B Realty Group, but the buildings were branded Oakwood. I used to be a caddie when I was 12 or 13, at a place called the Oakwood Country Club. The place seemed like the most deluxe thing I\u2019d ever seen in my life. So I liked the name Oakwood.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/z-how22_11.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-780672\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/z-how22_11.jpg?w=864 038 h=600\" alt=\"Z-HOW22_1\" width=\"864\" height=\"600\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Torrance, 90503: Singles  8220 living where the fun is 8221  at the South Bay Club circa 1965<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Eventually we grew to 58 offices throughout the U.S. We added property companies that had small units to our supplier network. In 1994, Oakwood Worldwide became the first national network of third-party corporate housing. Today we have more than 970 in that network in the U.S., and more than 1,100 outside the country. Abroad we started with buildings in London, Brussels, and Frankfurt, and Japan was our first target in Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Challenges came along the way. If the marketplace was down, and corporations were down, we\u2019d shrink our workforce, take the furniture out to warehouses, and rent the units as unfurnished apartments.<\/p>\n<p>The two biggest things in the last 15 years that affected our business were technology and globalization. We watched when Jack Welch went to India and started the first major U.S. call center there. Many people expanded overseas. They asked if we\u2019d go over there, and we expanded to Korea, China, India, and the Philippines.<\/p>\n<p style=\"width:475px line-height:1em text-align:center border:8px color:white background-color:black padding:7px \"><span style=\"font-size:24px font-weight:bold \">\u201cI keep working because that   s who I am. I   m among the last of the Depression kids. Business helps keep me alive.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Eventually we contacted Goldman Sachs <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/gs\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GS<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and said we\u2019d like to find a joint venture partner who\u2019d construct buildings, and we\u2019d manage them. This year we selected Mapletree Group, one of the largest developers in Singapore. Through the joint venture, we will develop some $4 billion worth of corporate and serviced apartment assets in Asia, Europe, and North America.<\/p>\n<p>The Oakwood brand developed over nearly 50 years. We\u2019re the biggest company in the corporate-housing business. The extended-stay places attached to hotel chains average six-day stays. We average 60-day stays.<\/p>\n<p>Today we give operational reports and tie into the financial statements of corporations that outsource their temporary housing. We give them peace of mind, particularly overseas, with security. We can tell a company where all its people are, whether there\u2019s a tornado, or a war overseas. That\u2019s part of the quality we offer. It\u2019s not just about whether you clean the apartment well.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to Oakwood, photography is a passion of mine. A few years ago I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a disease most people know as tunnel vision. I didn\u2019t realize I had it until I was 65, and it inspired me to capture as much of our world as possible through the lens of my camera.<\/p>\n<p>The disease was mild at first, then got more serious. I can\u2019t ski, golf, or fly-fish anymore. I have a machine that blows up documents so I can read them. Each day my eyes see differently, and the machine adjusts things so I can see and read. I typically see things in yellow-green, or purple on some days. I have someone who goes on business trips with me. You make do.<\/p>\n<p>Twelve years ago I went to northern Canada and saw the plight of polar bears, who are starving because they can\u2019t feed where the ice is melting. I partnered with the National Wildlife Federation and set up Climateclassroomkids.org, with lesson plans about the changing environment around the world. Pictures of wildlife from my travels hang in Oakwood apartments, which has sparked interest from our guests. Businesses have the biggest impact on the environment, and have the money to do something about it in a bigger way than the average family.<\/p>\n<p>I keep working because that\u2019s who I am. I\u2019m among the last of the Depression kids. Business helps keep me alive. People who retire don\u2019t tend to live as long. Everybody has medical issues as they age. Some have it a lot worse than I do. There\u2019s going to be a lot of people who work long after age 65 in the coming years, and it\u2019ll be the best thing they could do for themselves.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:32px \">MyAdvice:<\/span> <span style=\"color:#ff0000 font-size:24px \">Howard Ruby<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Founder, chairman, and CEO of Oakwood Worldwide<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>HAVE FOUR EYES THAT GO AROUND YOUR HEAD<\/strong> Look out for the competition at every turn and observe what   s happening around you.

a tech strike force fix Washington?","content":"<p>Two years ago the country\u2019s top technology officer pitched President Obama a bold idea. Todd Park had been mulling over how to inject some Silicon Valley zing into the federal bureaucracy. The answer came at a floating monthly breakfast he attended with about 50 of the administration\u2019s tech-savviest operatives\u2014an unofficial group that calls itself the Innovation Cohort. Park had notched some wins for the White House by bringing in heavy hitters from outside government to handle discrete challenges. Why not scale that up?<\/p>\n<p>Park\u2014along with a deputy, a Harvard-educated former minor-league infielder named John Paul Farmer\u2014proposed assembling a band of tech-industry standouts to tackle problems in the executive branch. Recruits would act with surgical precision, with one or two deployed per project and a mandate to achieve it within six months.<\/p>\n<p>It turned out to be an easy sell. The President, after all, had won office promising to move the country past the old ideological fight over the size of government toward a more efficient system. With Obama\u2019s sign-off, the Presidential Innovation Fellows\u2014or PIFs, as they\u2019ve become known around the White House\u2014were born.<\/p>\n<p style=\"width:475px line-height:1.5em text-align:center border:8px color:white background-color:black padding:7px \"><span style=\"font-size:24px font-weight:bold \">\u201cAs innovators we always favor more flexibility in developing solutions.

Before the PIFs got started, they went through half a week of training alongside the civil servants they were about to partner with. They learned about the \u201clean startup\u201d\u2014a Silicon Valley approach calling for experiment-driven product development\u2014and \u201cdesign thinking,\u201d another model for testing new ideas, developed by the design consultancy IDEO. \u201cAs innovators, we always favor more flexibility in developing solutions,\u201d says Garren Givens, a first-round PIF who now directs the program. \u201cThe problem with laws is they aren\u2019t always agile.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/08\/08\/cybersecurity-women-cyberjutsu\/\" target=\"_blank\">These women are training to be hackers<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That tech procurement reform was included in the first round of projects soon proved prophetic. In October 2013, about halfway through the second round, a massive tech procurement failure spawned the federal insurance-exchange website HealthCare.gov, a bug-ridden, anger-inducing disaster that threatened to sink Obama\u2019s greatest legacy. The fiasco was like a Times Square billboard boldly advertising everything wrong with the old way of doing things: Arcane contracting weeded out startups in favor of entrenched players, who then followed established practices that eschewed the testing the PIFs had learned specifically to prevent a meltdown. \u201cIt solidified why it was so important to have a standing SWAT team,\u201d Farmer says.<\/p>\n<p>Obama asked Park to organize the emergency response to salvage the web portal for the new health exchange, and Park in turn tapped four PIFs\u2014two alums and two current fellows\u2014to pitch in on the rescue. One alumnus, Greg Gershman, recalls the triage as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime experience.\u201d Still, Gershman is frustrated. Another project he worked on as a PIF\u2014an effort called MyUSA, which aims to make it easier for citizens to interact online with the federal government\u2014remains shelved two years after he developed a working prototype  it\u2019s partly a victim of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The 1995 law, intended to keep government from overburdening people and businesses with information requests, is now hamstringing technologists like the PIFs, who want to run pilot tests that solicit public feedback for their innovations before they tweak and expand them, a.k.a. that whole lean-startup thing.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/tec22_3.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/tec22_3.jpg?w=1024 038 h=683\" alt=\"Presidential Innovation Fellows\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" class=\"size-full wp-image-780656\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">President Obama meets with Presidential Innovation Fellows in January 2013<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Pete Souza\u2014The White House<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Clay Johnson, the PIF who tackled the small-bore tech procurement reform project, says it is \u201cAmerica\u2019s worst law.\u201d He blames it and other bureaucratic hurdles for thwarting the broad adoption of an online-bidding process he developed to save the feds an estimated $24 billion a year on tech spending, more than NASA\u2019s annual budget. Johnson was once the digital guru of Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign, but he now says the small-vs.-big-government debate that consumes our politics misses the point: The bureaucracy\u2019s inability to modernize is \u201cthe government\u2019s climate change,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we don\u2019t fix it soon, it will mean the end of government as we know it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"width:475px line-height:1em text-align:center border:8px color:white background-color:black padding:7px margin-left:25px \"><span style=\"font-size:24px font-weight:bold \">Recruits would act with surgical precision, with one or two deployed per project and a mandate to achieve it within six months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>White House officials might not frame it so darkly, but they acknowledge the challenge. Park points to a pair of fresh initiatives designed to address the barriers that exasperated the first class of PIFs. In April the administration launched a permanent corps of technologists called 18F. The idea is to expand the ranks of those toiling to wrench the federal government into the 21st century and recognize that many of the projects will take more than six months to execute. More than half of the PIFs from the program\u2019s second round have decided to stay on the job by moving to 18F. And in August the White House announced a new arm, dubbed the U.S. Digital Service and helmed by a former Google engineer, to clear a path through cobwebs of outdated policies so that the projects can advance. Park, meanwhile, will leave his post in September to move back west as a White House adviser in Silicon Valley, tasked with recruiting talent into government.<\/p>\n<p>The test begins this month when the third round of PIFs begin.

Over that span the S&amp P 500 Energy Index has underperformed the broader S&amp P by nearly 26 percentage points. Why? A relatively stable geopolitical scene and the shale boom in the U.S. have boosted supplies and combined to obscure what the fund manager views to be strong long-term fundamentals for the sector. \u201cYou have to be patient,\u201d says Waghorn, 41, co-manager of Guinness Atkinson Global Energy, the top-performing fund in the sector over the past decade. \u201cIt\u2019s always annoying when your view is ignored for a long period of time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now, finally, there are signs that investors may be poised to come around to Waghorn\u2019s way of thinking\u2014especially given the spike in conflicts in oil-rich regions around the world. Escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic Sunni militants in Iraq have raised fears about future supply disruptions at a time when demand in a recovering global economy appears to be gaining momentum. Consider that the International Energy Agency estimates that Iraq will deliver 60% of OPEC\u2019s supply growth through the end of the decade\u2014an increasingly dubious projection. \u201cI think that it\u2019s fair to say, given recent events, one has to at least question the likelihood of all of that supply coming onstream,\u201d says Poppy Allonby, portfolio manager of the BlackRock Commodity Strategies Fund.<\/p>\n<p>The case for oil stocks is built on more than turmoil in the Middle East, however. \u201cI think the world has gotten too negative on demand and too bullish on supply,\u201d says Mike Wilson, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, which oversees $2 trillion in assets. Wilson says the energy sector has been unfairly oversold, making this a great entry point. The S&amp P 500 energy index currently trades at 15 times this year\u2019s earnings, or an 11% discount to the S&amp P 500. \u201cPeople are basically writing off energy forever, and that\u2019s just not where we are,\u201d says Wilson.<\/p>\n<p style=\"width:475px line-height:1.5em text-align:center border:8px color:white background-color:black padding:7px \"><span style=\"font-size:24px font-weight:bold \">\u201cThe opportunities are fantastic, and we\u2019re in the very early innings of a renaissance in the energy industry.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px \">\u2014<em>Craig Hodges, CEO of Hodges Capital<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the arrow is already pointing up for oil prices: While spot prices have dipped 8% over the past six months, futures prices for crude contracts two to five years from now have jumped as much as 11%. That not only foreshadows more expensive oil but also means oil companies are already reaping the benefits. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realize that oil companies don\u2019t sell their oil at today\u2019s prices. They sell it at future prices, and they\u2019re now selling oil at better prices than they were six months ago,\u201d says Wilson.<\/p>\n<p>When the price of oil rises, producers tend to drill as much of it out of the ground as quickly as they can. Craig Hodges, who runs about $3 billion at Hodges Capital in Dallas, knows this well. So he\u2019s moving aggressively to capitalize on the opportunity. Nearly a fifth of his Hodges Small Cap Fund\u2014ranked No. 1 in its Morningstar category over the past five years\u2014is now in energy stocks, a much bigger bet on the industry than he\u2019s ever made before.<\/p>\n<p>Among Hodges\u2019s favorite picks are shale specialists Matador Resources <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MTDR\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/mtdr\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MTDR<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and Comstock Resources <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"CRK\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/crk\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">CRK<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, both of which have pivoted from drilling for natural gas to producing oil after natural-gas prices collapsed in the U.S. due to the flood of supply caused by the fracking revolution. Rather than worrying about an oil glut, Hodges envisions a day when the U.S. will be energy self-sufficient\u2014and may even begin exporting oil, as the government this summer loosened its 40-year ban on crude exports. \u201cThe opportunities are fantastic, and we\u2019re in the very early innings of a renaissance in the energy industry,\u201d says Hodges.<\/p>\n<p>Oil production in the U.S. continues to surge. The Energy Information Administration predicts that it will surpass 8.5 million barrels per day this year, up from less than 5 million in 2008. But U.S. consumption is heating up as well. According to OPEC, demand is expected to increase in developed nations in 2015 for the first time in four years, with all the gains coming from North America. At the same time, the thirst for oil is only increasing in emerging markets like China, India, and Brazil.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/inv.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-780606\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/inv.jpg?w=550 038 h=193\" alt=\"CRUDE THIRST Strong demand in the developing world is driving growth in global oil consumption.\" width=\"550\" height=\"193\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\"><strong>CRUDE THIRST<\/strong> Strong demand in the developing world is driving growth in global oil consumption.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Graphic Source: OECD  IEA<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Global growth is reason enough to invest in energy for Maarten Bloemen, who manages $2.5 billion for Franklin Templeton.

His philosophy emphasizes accelerating growth, an approach that has helped his fund return an average 8.7% per year, vs. 6.9% for the S&amp P 500, since he took over in 2008. A recent favorite: Sensata Technologies, which makes sensors that, say, regulate engines to save fuel and turn cars into sophisticated electronic machines. Tierney thinks the company can sustain 15% annual revenue growth for the next five years. <\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">Sensor Sensation<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nSensata\u2019s growth \u201cisn\u2019t about how many cars there are,\u201d Tierney says. \u201cIt is about how electronic the cars can be.\u201d Both governments (hoping to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy) and customers (who like safer braking) are pushing for more technology that depends on sensors. The opportunity is huge: A sophisticated Mercedes E-Class turbo diesel has $200 of sensor equipment in it\u2014but the average U.S.-built car has $25 worth of the technology. Whether or not auto sales rise, Tierney argues, those manufacturers will increasingly add sensors, driving sales for Sensata.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">A Precise Road Map<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nTierney admires the clear vision of Sensata CEO Martha Sullivan. She has vowed to double revenues between 2012 and 2017, he says, through organic growth and takeovers. (Revenues increased 13%, to $2.1 bil\u00adlion, in the fiscal year ended June 30.) Recently the company announced the acquisition of tire-sensor maker Schrader International, which is benefiting from its own tailwinds: Tire-pressure sensors are now required in North America and South Korea, and will be mandated for new cars in Europe after November 2014. Tierney says Schrader was a \u201cquality\u201d acquisition. <\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">Talking About China Growth<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nChina\u2019s market has by far the most potential for companies that supply carmakers with electronic technology, in Tierney\u2019s view. Vehicle sales are burgeoning\u201420 million vehicles a year, 11% more than in Europe, the next-biggest market. Given that the average car has a paltry average of $10 worth of sensors, demand is likely to speed up. Moreover, Sensata has a strong foothold in the Middle Kingdom: The company\u2019s clients (including Volkswagen and General Motors) account for seven of the top 10 most-sold<br \/>\nbrands there. <\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:30px padding-bottom:15px \">It\u2019s Priced Reasonably<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nComparing Sensata\u2019s valuation with those of its rivals is tricky, since most of them are buried within conglomerates. Sensata trades at 19 times forecast earnings over the next 12 months (adjusted for tax exemptions), lower than the 22 for a peer, Amphenol. Tierney thinks Sensata compares favorably with the S&amp P 500. Yes, that index has a lower price\/earnings ratio (16), but its growth is expected to be half of Sensata\u2019s over five years. \u201cYou get twice the growth while trading at only a three-point premium,\u201d Tierney says, adding that he thinks the stock price could jump 25% to $62 over 12 months or so. <\/p>\n<p><em>This story is from the September 22, 2014 issue of

Some are generalists, some are niche. Some are thought of as kingmakers, some as bottom feeders. In almost all cases (including on the fictionalized HBO show <em>Silicon Valley<\/em>), they have the same basic value proposition:<\/p>\n<p><em>We will provide your startup with expert mentorship, services, and connections, and in exchange you will provide us with equity.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The problem, of course, is that startups must agree to give up some of their ownership before learning whether the incubator will hold up its end of the bargain. Imagine paying for a haircut upfront, or for a restaurant meal as you\u2019re being seated. What if you end up with an inadvertent mullet or a piece of raw chicken?<\/p>\n<p>That needs to change, and one of the nation\u2019s largest tech incubators plans to lead the way.<\/p>\n<p>Techstars, which has worked with more than 450 startups in over a dozen locations, tells <em>Fortune<\/em> that it will offer an equity-back guarantee to its companies, beginning next year. It has traditionally required equity stakes ranging from 7% to 10% but, going forward,  8220 graduates 8221  will decide for themselves if the program deserves their stock.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur expectation is that we\u2019re going to earn it,\u201d explains David Cohen, a Boulder-based entrepreneur and venture capitalist who co-founded Techstars in 2006. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that Techstars is a very valuable product, where we feel we\u2019re the ones who are going to help make the introduction to their next investors and customers, but if an entrepreneur ultimately has an issue, we\u2019re not just going to make them stick to a number that they feel is unfair.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/pri.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-780589\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/pri.jpg?w=550 038 h=242\" alt=\"AN ACCELERATOR'S FAST START Techstars projects that it will counsel about 150 young companies this year, 15times the number that it did in 2007\" width=\"550\" height=\"242\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\"><strong>AN ACCELERATOR   S FAST START<\/strong> Techstars projects that it will counsel about 150 young companies this year, 15times the number that it did in 2007<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Graphic Source: Techstars<\/span><\/p>\n<p>To some extent, Techstars is just trying to better compete in a crowded incubator marketplace at a time when entrepreneurs have been conditioned to expect genuflection. But it is also responding to changing founder and startup demographics. Techstars and other incubators are beginning to see more repeat entrepreneurs express interest in their programs, often for more mature companies. A recent notable example was when Quora\u2014a five-year-old question-and-answer site that has raised more than $160 million of VC funding\u2014entered into the Y Combinator program. In many of these cases, the entrepreneur is even more hesitant to give up equity on day one. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing an uptick in the number of advanced companies and advanced entrepreneurs coming to Techstars,\u201d Cohen says. \u201cThey\u2019re maybe saying that they have momentum and aren\u2019t sure about the value on the front end\u2026so we\u2019re going to remove that roadblock.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The big question now is whether other prominent incubators\u2014especially Y Combinator, which incubated such startups as Airbnb, Dropbox, and Twitch\u2014will follow suit. To be sure, there are inherent risks. Techstars spends money on services for each startup\u2014and also invests $118,000 in seed capital (specific dollar amounts vary by program). Not only could it receive nothing in return from a disgruntled founder, but it could lose out from a selfish one as well. The bull case is that those scofflaws probably are not running anything that will create value anyway, since successful entrepreneurs wouldn\u2019t want to anger groups whose mentor rosters are filled with potential funding sources.<\/p>\n<p>So I\u2019d expect other major incubators to let Techstars de-risk the process. If there are no major flare-ups, they\u2019ll fall into line. The result would be more equitable deals for entrepreneurs and increased applicant pools for the incubators.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps most important, it could help founders navigate better between the contenders and pretenders. If a program is confident that it will provide demonstrable value, then it should be willing to put its money where its mouth is. If not, then that should be a giant warning sign for founders. That guidance alone might be worth a few shares.<\/p>\n<p><em>Subscribe to Dan Primack   s daily newsletter at <a href=\"http:\/\/GetTermSheet.com\">GetTermSheet.com<\/a><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story is from the September 22, 2014 issue of Fortune.<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 4, 2014","published":"2014-09-04 07:30:55","updated":"2014-09-04 07:30:55","minute":"7:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/techstars-incubator-mentorship\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/techstars-incubator-mentorship\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/technology-icon-thumbnail.jpg?w=550&h= 5&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_half","credit":"Kyle Bean for Fortune","caption":"","attach_id":"500625"},"short_title":"Here's a radical idea: Let startups choose whether to pay for mentorship","excerpt":"<p>Business incubator Techstars searches for a better way to compete in a crowded incubator marketplace.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"381342","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/dan-primack\/","name":"Dan Primack","twitter":"danprimack","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/dan_primack_130.jpg?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"dan_primack_130\" \/>","bio":"","title":"","company":""}],"sections":[{"term_id":829614,"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46728,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News, analysis, and insight into technology and business, including Silicon Valley giants like Apple, Google, Facebook, and our annual Brainstorm Tech conference.","parent":0,"count":12912,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/category\/tech\/"},"tags":[{"term_id":1028815,"name":"incubators","slug":"incubators","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":112168,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":3,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":20429,"name":"Startups","slug":"startups","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":47126,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":112,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":142779,"name":"Tech Startups","slug":"tech-startups","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":60206,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":82,"filter":"raw"}],"primary_tag":{"name":"Startups","slug":"startups","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/startups\/"},"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"Business incubator Techstars searches for a better way to compete in a crowded incubator marketplace.","seo":{"seo_title":"Here's a radical idea: Let startups choose whether to pay for mentorship","seo_description":"Business incubator Techstars searches for a better way to compete in a crowded incubator marketplace.","seo_keywords":"Techstars, incubator, startup","seo_news_keywords":"Techstars, incubator, startup","seo_additional_meta":""},"social":{"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2014%2F09%2F04%2Ftechstars-incubator-mentorship%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F1lwhXUL","encoded_title":"Here%E2%80%99s+a+radical+idea%3A+Let+startups+choose+whether+to+pay+for%C2%A0mentorship","twitter_text":"Here's a radical idea: Let startups choose whether to pay for\u00a0mentorship","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"Business incubator Techstars searches for a better way to compete in a crowded incubator marketplace.","facebook_title":"Here's a radical idea: Let startups choose whether to pay for mentorship"},"format":{"term_id":2710,"name":"Article","slug":"fortune-post-format-article","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"fortune_post_format","description":"","parent":0,"count":6163,"filter":"raw"},"related_posts":[]},{"id":778628,"url":"\/2014\/09\/04\/big-cities-benefit-from-free-trade\/","title":"Big cities benefit from free trade\u2014so why are Democrats stalling it?","content":"You wouldn\u2019t know it from the behavior of leading Washington Democrats, but guess who benefits most from free-trade pacts?

And we will continue to do so\u2014even if we end up on Thiel\u2019s seastead.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m particularly excited because the businesses we cover\u2014from the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\">Fortune 500<\/a> to the companies that aspire to be\u2014face three key challenges in the coming years, each of them potentially existential, and all well worthy of our journalistic efforts.<\/p>\n<p>The first is the challenge from within. Can big global companies, created to meet the organizational needs of the 20th century, remain relevant in the 21st? Nobel-\u00adwinning economist Ronald Coase told us why we needed these bureaucratic behemoths. The complications of assembling the capital and labor necessary to build railroads, telephone networks, or mass-produced automobiles were simply too great to be negotiated in open markets. Corporate bureaucracy was the necessary antidote.<\/p>\n<p>But in today\u2019s world, where I can sit in my bedroom, assemble a talented team on LinkedIn, put my intellectual property in the cloud, manufacture on 3-D printers, and market across the web, what exactly is the purpose of the large corporation? Can it innovate as well as the crowd? Is it flexible enough to keep up with today\u2019s pace of change? These are questions every Fortune 500 CEO is grappling with. Our goal at <em>Fortune<\/em> is to shine light on the path to some 21st-century answers.<\/p>\n<p>Then there is the challenge from without. I am a firm believer in the power of free people and free markets. But I\u2019ve been surprised by the degree to which the challenge to those basic principles has taken hold since the 2007 financial crisis. You don\u2019t have to have read all 685 pages of Thomas Piketty\u2019s <em>Capital<\/em>\u2014and evidence suggests very few people have\u2014to recognize that there is a potent populist stew brewing in the land. Public support for business\u2014particularly big business\u2014is flagging, both on the left and on the right. In my 2007 book, <em>Revolt in the Boardroom<\/em>, I argued that public corporations depended on the goodwill of the public to survive and thrive. They are losing that goodwill. My former colleagues at the Pew Research Center found that 78% of Americans believe \u201ctoo much power is concentrated in the hands of a few corporations.\u201d Regaining public support and acknowledgment of the noble purpose of business is a critical challenge for readers of these pages.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, there is the challenge from abroad. Like many Americans, I grew up thinking free people and free markets went hand in hand\u2014that capitalism and democracy were inextricably linked, and together represented the best hope for humanity. But that belief isn\u2019t universally shared. Democracy is being threatened around the world, and Chinese leaders\u2014who have a couple of awesome economic decades to show for their efforts\u2014are on a campaign to convince developing nations that they\u2019ve found a better answer to capitalism. The utter breakdown of Washington\u2019s ability to do, well, almost anything has nourished their argument. This is no small debate. History hangs in the balance.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a lot of ground to cover. And in the meantime, we have some challenges of our own\u2014making sure that <em>Fortune\u2019s<\/em> great journalism is available to you on multiple platforms so that you get the information, analysis, and insights you need wherever, whenever, and in whatever form you choose.<\/p>\n<p>So stay tuned. Much more to come.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story is from the September 22, 2014 issue of Fortune.<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 4, 2014","published":"2014-09-04 07:41:01","updated":"2014-09-04 07:41:01","minute":"7:41 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/the-story-business\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/04\/the-story-business\/","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/edd_alanmurray_print.jpg?w=407","class":"featured-img-article_portrait","credit":"Photograph by Wesley Mann for Fortune","caption":"","attach_id":"782036"},"short_title":"The Story Business","excerpt":"<p>Fortune welcomes new managing editor Alan Murray.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"779924","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/alan-murray\/","name":"Alan Murray","twitter":"alansmurray","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img alt='' src='http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/?s=59 038 d=identicon 038 r=G' class='avatar avatar-59' height='59' width='59' \/>","bio":"","title":"","company":""}],"sections":[{"term_id":9548,"name":"Features","slug":"features","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46733,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and in-depth looks at topics of interest to the Forune audience, with a focus on storytelling and context of the news you need to know.","parent":0,"count":3611,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Features","slug":"features","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/category\/features\/"},"tags":[{"term_id":279 4,"name":"Editor's Desk","slug":"editors-desk","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":112592,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw"}],"primary_tag":{"name":"Editor's Desk","slug":"editors-desk","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/editors-desk\/"},"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"Fortune welcomes new managing editor Alan Murray.","seo":{"seo_title":"The Story Business","seo_description":"Fortune welcomes new managing editor Alan Murray.","seo_keywords":"","seo_news_keywords":"","seo_additional_meta":""},"social":{"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2014%2F09%2F04%2Fthe-story-business%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F1A2pfRs","encoded_title":"The+story+of%C2%A0business","twitter_text":"The story of\u00a0business","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"Fortune welcomes new managing editor Alan Murray.","facebook_title":"The Story Business"},"format":{"term_id":2710,"name":"Article","slug":"fortune-post-format-article","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"fortune_post_format","description":"","parent":0,"count":6147,"filter":"raw"},"related_posts":[]},{"id":778693,"url":"\/2014\/09\/04\/a-tale-of-terror\/","title":"A tale of terror","content":"<p>I was on just the other side of the TSA security gate when, in my customary every-five-minute self-patdown to make sure all my peripherals are in order, I realized that my front right pants pocket was empty. This ordinarily means little. But it was hot that day, and I had removed my suit jacket and packed it into my wheelie bag while I was in the Town Car to the airport, requiring the shifting of my phone to that uncustomary location. In the car I had then moved it to an even more bizarre spot on the top of my luggage for, you know, greater convenience during the ride. Upon arrival, I had, apparently, taken my bag rather heedlessly, it being an ungodly early hour, and I had left my phone behind. I saw it there in my mind\u2019s eye, on the car\u2019s back seat. I imagined it ringing. Bob was on the other end of the line. \u201cWhere the !#$ is Bing?\u201d he was thinking.<\/p>\n<p>It takes stupidity to misplace your phone. I mean, you check yourself only\u2014what?\u2014six times an hour to make sure you haven\u2019t left some part of yourself somewhere. Or perhaps it\u2019s not simple stupidity, but something deeper. A profound need to be out of touch, maybe.<\/p>\n<p>Now there was only self-reproach. Terror. And a vast, aching sense of aloneness in the universe, a feeling of infinitesimal smallness in the teeming cosmos of people who do have their phones with them.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing that occurs to you when you lose your phone is that you don\u2019t have a phone to call anybody with to tell them that you\u2019ve lost your phone. Then a huge chasm of fear opens beneath your feet, a teeming Hell populated by screaming, tormented souls trying to get in touch with you. \u201cMust get phone,\u201d I said to myself. But\u2009\u2026 where? A computerized schematic popped up in my brain screen. There was an electronics store not 50 feet down the way! \u201cWe don\u2019t have phones,\u201d said the sales guy. He was standing in front of about an acre of phone paraphernalia. \u201cBut there\u2019s a dude about a mile down on the left who might sell them.\u201d I walked and walked and walked, aware that if this option failed, I was looking at hours\u2014days?!\u2014of being\u2009\u2026\u2009nowhere.<\/p>\n<p>The guy had one. Cost about $100. Ugly little thing. Inelegant. He set it up for me. \u201cI do this kind of thing for my grandma all the time,\u201d he said as he worked. I called my key people. Made an amusing story out of it. Gave them my new temporary number. Called my office and barked some orders related to finding my real phone, which they did. Arranged for it to be sent by intercompany pouch to my pending location. It would be delivered\u2014without fail\u2014to my desk on Monday morning. Just one weekend without my frenemy. I figured I could handle that. I patted the ersatz little brick in my pocket. It was insufficient. But it would serve. I was back on planet business again.<\/p>\n<p>I should tell you the last part, when I got my phone back. It\u2019s not a pretty story, although it ends all right. The phone was not on my desk without fail. I realized it when I was having my second cup of coffee. And\u2014this is rich\u2014I had left my temporary implement back on my nightstand! I really have to see a therapist about my relationship with my electronics.<\/p>\n<p>Well, I went nuts. I screamed at my assistant, although none of this was her fault. I screamed at the mailrooms on both coasts. I screamed at my New York office, which had, it turned out, put my phone in the wrong intercompany transport system. I yelled and thundered and threw my weight around like a little baby deprived of its rattle for about 20 minutes. And then they found my phone and brought it to me. It was swaddled in bubble wrap and cardboard. I tore it open and brushed it off. And there it was, stuffed with all my contacts and games and other apps, staring mutely back at me. I hefted it in my hand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou again,\u201d I said.<\/p>\n<p><em>Follow Stanley Bing at stanleybing.com and on Twitter at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thebingblog\"
