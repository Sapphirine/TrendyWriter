I think &#8216;war&#8217; is the wrong reference term with respect to that, but obviously it involves kinetic military action.&#8221; National Security Advisor Susan Rice weighed in Thursday to CNN that &#8220;I think, frankly, this is a counterterrorism operation that will take time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But by Friday afternoon, the White House and the Pentagon were reversing course. &#8220;Make no mistake, we know we are at war with [ISIS], in the same way we are at war, and continue to be at war, with al-Qaeda and its affiliates,&#8221; Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said, referencing a long-term, largely-airborne campaign against the terrorist group.<\/p>\n<p>At the White House, the same word was used. &#8220;The United States is at war with [ISIS] in the same way we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates,&#8221; echoed White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest minutes later. &#8220;The United States is at war with [ISIS].&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Only Congress can formally declare war under the U.S. Constitution. The White House said Obama is now relying on the 2001 post-9\/11 Authorization for the Use of Military Force against al Qaeda as a Congressional justification for the campaign against ISIS.<\/p>\n<p>It was far from the first mixed message sent by the administration in the months-long conflict. Last month Obama suggested he had &#8220;no strategy&#8221; for dealing with ISIS in Syria. Later Obama suggested ISIS could be contained to become &#8220;a manageable problem&#8221; in the region. Finally, as he reiterated to the nation on Wednesday night, Obama promised to &#8220;degrade and ultimately destroy&#8221; the militant group, but he did not describe the metrics that would be used to know when either of those goals were achieved.<\/p>\n<p>The confusing language has drawn fire from Republicans and puzzling looks from Democrats, but hasn&#8217;t yet undermined the emerging broad-based support among the American people for the airstrikes.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3341270\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Lipstadt makes far too little of the relationship between Israel&rsquo;s policies in the West Bank and Gaza and growing anti-Semitism in Europe and beyond. The trend to which she alludes parallels the carnage in Gaza over the last five years, not to mention the perpetually stalled peace talks and the continuing occupation of the West Bank. As hope for a two-state solution fades and Palestinian casualties continue to mount, the best antidote to anti-Semitism would be for Israel&rsquo;s patrons abroad to press the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for final-status resolution to the Palestinian question.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Within hours of the letter&#8217;s publication, Shipman says, people on and off campus began calling for his ouster. Two weeks later, he resigned. Why this happened&mdash;and what&#8217;s at stake&mdash;depends on who you ask.<\/p>\n<p>Shipman has a long history of sympathy for the plight of Palestinians. As a teenager, he lived in Egypt while his father worked for World Health Organization and was there when Israel invaded during the 1956 Suez War. &#8220;Among my friends were Palestinian refugees and their children who were my age, so I heard their stories of dispossession and loss, people who had lost their homes and their farms and cut off from their land living in Jaffa and in the area which is now known as Israel,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>He has visited Israel and the Palestinian territories more than a dozen times. This spring, he took a group of Yale students on a spring trip to Bethlehem and Jerusalem. &#8220;There is an apartheid situation there,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It is unpopular to say so, but it is the truth.&#8221; His letter, he explains, &#8220;suggested that in looking at the uptick in anti-Semitism in Europe and in the world, there is a correlation between the unresolved issues in Israel\/Palestine, the recent war in Gaza and the terrible damage incurred by that war, the awful civilian casualties, and all of this I believe has contributed to an uptick in anti-Semitic violence,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That is what I said, and that is what I meant.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Many people swiftly pounced. Yale pointed out that Shipman was not on staff but was rather employed by the Episcopal Church. Chabad at Yale, a Jewish student group, issued this statement: &#8220;Reverend Bruce Shipman&rsquo;s justification of anti-semitism by blaming it on Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza is frankly quite disturbing. His argument attempts to justify racism and hate of innocent people, in Israel and around the world.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Religion columnist and Yale lecturer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tabletmag.com\/scroll\/183402\/the-yale-chaplain-who-doesnt-get-jews\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Oppenheimer<\/a> wrote that Shipman&#8217;s approach &#8220;gives license to all sorts of stereotyping, racism, and prejudice. . . . why wouldn&rsquo;t one write, &#8216;The best antidote to stop-and-frisk policing would be for black men everywhere to press other black men to stop shooting each other&#8217;? Why wouldn&rsquo;t one write&mdash;perhaps after a Muslim was beaten up by white-supremacist thugs&mdash;&#8217;The best antidote to Islamophobia would be for radical Islam&rsquo;s patrons abroad to press ISIS and Al Qaeda to just cut it out&#8217;?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/volokh-conspiracy\/wp\/2014\/08\/26\/episcopal-chaplain-at-yale-jews-are-to-blame-for-anti-semitism-for-not-making-peace-with-genocidal-enemy\/\" target=\"_blank\">David Bernstein wrote for the Washington Post<\/a>, &#8220;Next on Rev. Shipman&rsquo;s bucket list: blaming women who dress provocatively for rape, blaming blacks for racism because of high crime rates, and blaming gays for homophobia for being &#8216;flamboyant.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The official reason for Shipman&#8217;s resignation, according to the Episcopal Church at Yale, was not the letter but &#8220;dynamics between the Board of Governors and the Priest-in-Charge.&#8221; Ian Douglas, bishop of Connecticut and president of the board of governors for the Episcopal Church at Yale, emphasized this distinction to<a href=\"http:\/\/yaledailynews.com\/blog\/2014\/09\/09\/amidst-controversy-university-reverend-resigns\/\" target=\"_blank\"> the Yale Daily News<\/a>. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not as glamorous a story to hear that Priest-in-Charge Bruce Shipman resigned because of institutional dynamics within the Episcopal Church at Yale and not the debates related to Israel and Palestine &mdash; but it&rsquo;s the truth,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Shipman disagrees. &#8220;This story cannot be simply dismissed as the inner problems of the Episcopal Church at Yale. It was not,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It was this letter that set off the firestorm.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For Shipman, the controversy raises a number of &#8220;troubling questions&#8221; about free speech on campus. In addition to the hate mail, Shipman says he has also received letters of support from people thanking him for taking a courageous stand for Palestinian rights. University chaplains, he adds, have a long history advocating unpopular cultural positions. William Sloane Coffin Jr., a chaplain at Yale during the 1960s, gained fame for practicing civil disobedience in prostest of the U.S. war in Vietnam. Clergy today, he continues, need to know what protections they do and don&#8217;t have when it comes to taking unpopular positions. &#8220;I think of abolitionism and the role the church played in that, I think of the civil rights movement, I think of the anti-war movement and the role the chaplains played in that, often incurring the wrath of big givers and donors of the university, but they were protected and they were respected,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That seems not to be the case now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As to what&#8217;s next for him, Shipman isn&#8217;t yet sure, but he doesn&#8217;t plan on remaining silent. &#8220;I think the truth must be brought out and it must be discussed on campus by people of goodwill without labeling anti-Semitic anyone who raises these questions,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Surely this debate should take place on the campuses of the leading universities across the country. If not there, where?&#8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3340634\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will be the keynote speakers at retiring Sen. Tom Harkin&rsquo;s 37<sup>th<\/sup> and last steak fry. Some 5,000 people&mdash;a third of the town&rsquo;s population of 15,000&mdash;are expected to attend, including more than 200 journalists from around the world.<\/p>\n<p>The former first lady&rsquo;s every handshake and utterance will surely be parsed for signs of whether she&rsquo;ll run for President again in 2016. This will be Clinton&rsquo;s first trip back to Iowa since her humiliating third-place loss in the caucuses in 2008, a setback that ultimately cost her the nomination. Just in case she&rsquo;s forgotten this painful fact, the Republican National Committee made a highlight reel of Clinton&rsquo;s past failures in Iowa to remind her.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/vo_zDE0XcE4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The event will surely look like a campaign. Ready for Hillary, her shadow grassroots campaign will be on hand to greet the former New York senator and Secretary of State. They have been encouraging Iowans to register for the event for months, and they&rsquo;ll have the &ldquo;Ready for Hillary&rdquo; bus there.<\/p>\n<p>As she was when she last attended this event seven years ago, Clinton is heavily favored to win the caucuses. If the caucuses were held today she&rsquo;d garner 53% of the vote, according to a CNN\/ORC poll of registered Iowa voters out Friday. That blows away the field: Vice President Joe Biden comes in a distant second with 15%, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has said repeatedly she won&rsquo;t run, get&rsquo;s 7%, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has 5%, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo 3%, Maryland Gov. Martin O&rsquo;Malley 2% and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick 1%.<\/p>\n<p>And one of the biggest differences between 2007 and now is that at that Steak Fry, which is an annual fundraiser, then Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards were eagerly anticipated guests in attendance. Ultimately, Obama would win the caucuses and Edwards would come in second. This time, there&rsquo;s no rival in sight. Well, Sanders may show up (he&rsquo;s holding an event in Des Moines that night), but few believe he&rsquo;s a threat to Clinton the way Obama and Edwards were.<\/p>\n<p>That said, many Iowans view Clinton&rsquo;s candidacy with a grain of salt, and some will come to the Steak Fry to see how she behaves. She ran a decidedly non-retail campaign in 2008, visiting less than 60 of the 99 counties. Bill Clinton didn&rsquo;t contest Iowa in 1992 as his host, Harkin, was on the ballot and an easy shoo-in. And he didn&rsquo;t bother much with it during his reelection. Which means that Iowans feel like they don&rsquo;t truly know the Clintons they way they know other politicians who&rsquo;ve come to pay homage to the fickle first voters. And they&rsquo;ll expect&mdash;or at least hope for&mdash;some signs of courtship from the Clintons.<\/p>\n<p>Officially, Clinton isn&#8217;t running for President. She said last week that she&#8217;d make up her mind after Jan. 1 if she&#8217;ll enter the race. But that won&#8217;t stop speculation from running rampant. Let the pseudo-shadow-non-campaigning begin.<\/p>\n","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Why does Turkey feel they don't need to be apart of the fight against ISIS when they have been one of the countries leading the charge against Assad and support of rebels in the Syrian civil war?<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello and thanks for the question. I am actually in Ankara right now with Secretary of State John Kerry, who has come here for meetings on this issue. This is a delicate situation for Turkey. You may also have noticed that Turkey attended the Gulf Cooperation Council meeting led by John Kerry in Jeddah yesterday &mdash; but that it did not sign the group&rsquo;s communiqu&eacute; pledging a unified effort against ISIS. Administration officials insist that Turkey is helping, although they&rsquo;d like to see more progress. Why so delicate? Primarily because ISIS is holding 49 Turkish diplomats and security officers hostage &mdash; all captured the group captured the Iraqi city of Mosul and overran the Turkish consulate there in June. The Turks are obviously hope to get the hostages back alive and are trying not to provoke ISIS in a way that might lead to their harm. Officials say that Turkey has taken steps to stop foreign fighters from flying into the country and crossing the border into Syria. Six thousand have been denied entry to the country and another thousand have been deported, according to a State Department official. But Washington wants to see more progress on that front. The U.S. is also asking Turkey to crack down on ISIS oil smuggling over its borders which is bringing the group significant revenue. How much the hostage situation will complicate those efforts remains to be seen. In fact, just as I was about to send this, John Kerry visited the press here to make a statement. He is standing ten feet away from me now, declaring that &ldquo;Turkey and the United States will stand together against any challenges within the region &mdash; including all terrorism.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>deconstructiva asks, Michael, do you see Kurdistan going independent soon? (I asked Jay Newton-Small a similar question during her Q+A, now it's your turn!) I think they will thanks to growing differences with Iraq and better relations with Turkey, not to mention their oil. It is interesting that oil can play a key role in a region's potential independence, in this case for both Kurdistan and Scotland.<\/p><\/b>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Dollar General paid a settlement of almost $19 million to 2,100 female employees for not paying them equal wages.<\/p>\n<p>Democrats nationally and in races like Georgia&#8217;s have pushed the idea that Republicans are not for equal pay and have spoken of the GOP waging a &#8220;war against women&#8221; on reproductive and economic policy. It has proven an effective message with female voters. Democrats lost the women&#8217;s vote in 2010, and with it control of the House and six Senate seats. Determined not to make the same mistake, they introduced a women&#8217;s economic agenda, including the Paycheck Fairness Act, which has been voted down twice in the Senate by Republicans this year. Republicans argue the bill is a sop to trial lawyers and have introduced their own version, which incentivizes employers to provide equal pay, rather than punishing them on the regulatory side, as the Democrats favor.<\/p>\n<p>Nunn is trailing Perdue slightly&mdash;by 1.6 percentage points&mdash; in polls, according to an average of Georgia polls by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.realclearpolitics.com\/epolls\/2014\/senate\/ga\/georgia_senate_perdue_vs_nunn-4040.html\" target=\"_blank\">Real Clear Politics<\/a>.

In order to win, she&#8217;ll need to maintain that edge and build on it. Thus the ads hitting Perdue as bad for women.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Women understand the negative impact of Obama&#8217;s failed policies better than anyone, from losing their doctors due to Obamacare and feeling the effects of Obama&#8217;s economy on their hard-earned paychecks,&#8221; says Megan Whittemore, a spokeswoman for the Perdue campaign. &#8220;David absolutely believes in equal pay for equal work. That is the law and he has always supported that. Unlike Michelle Nunn who will make it harder for women to succeed, David will be a strong voice for Georgia&#8217;s women and families in the U.S. Senate.&#8221; Meanwhile, Perdue has an ad out hitting her as too liberal for Georgia.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IEkFCukkH5Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3340709\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

intelligence officials previously believed, according to a new estimate from the Central Intelligence Agency.<\/p>\n<p>The CIA estimates that ISIS, the Islamist terrorist group that has declared a caliphate in the large swath of Iraq and Syria which it now controls, &ldquo;can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria, based on a new review of all-source intelligence reports from May to August, an increase from our previous assessment of at least 10,000 fighters,&rdquo; a CIA spokesperson said. That estimate accounts only for individuals fighting with ISIS itself, not with any affiliated group.<\/p>\n<p>The new estimate reflects a sharp uptick in recruitment over the summer &ldquo;following battlefield successes and the declaration of a caliphate,&rdquo; the CIA spokesperson said.<\/p>\n<p>The CIA believes more than 15,000 foreign fighters from 80 countries&mdash;at least 2,000 of whom are Westerners&mdash;have traveled to Syria to join ISIS ranks. A dozen or more could be Americans, the CIA believes.<\/p>\n<p>A U.S. intelligence official cautioned that the CIA&rsquo;s estimate is not a precise figure and reflects a broad approximation based on limited intelligence. &ldquo;The gap between the low and high points indicates there is uncertainty about the exact number of fighters in (ISIS),&rdquo; a US intelligence official said. &ldquo;Given the changing dynamics of the battlefield, new recruits, and other factors, it is difficult to assess the precise number of individuals in a terrorist group that is evolving and practices good operational security.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"2\"><object id=\"bc-video-3769770595001-2\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/WThdNU\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3769770595001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3340662\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/","description":"The latest news and analysis on crime, religion, education, transportation, weather, immigration, sports, drugs, the law, and other news from around the nation"},"tag":{"name":"intelligence","slug":"intelligence","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/intelligence\/"},"tags":"CIA|intelligence|Iraq|isis|national secrurity|Pentagon|Syria|Terror|Terrorism","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/isis-islamic-state.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/isis-islamic-state.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/isis-islamic-state.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/isis-islamic-state.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/isis-islamic-state.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"AP","caption":"Demonstrators chant pro-Islamic State group slogans as they carry the group's flags in front of the provincial government headquarters in Mosul, Iraq on June 16, 2014.
