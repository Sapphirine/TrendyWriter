<p><a href="http://the-affair.com/store">The Affair</a> is a London-based fashion brand that looks for inspiration in literature, producing t-shirts and prints inspired by notable books. But they've taken it up a notch for their newest collection on Kickstarter: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zoltancsaki/1984-stealth-fashion-for-the-under-surveillance-so">1984: Stealth Fashion for the Under-Surveillance Society</a>. 1984 is a collection of durable fashion inspired by the workwear clothing of the George Orwell novel and our post-Snowden surveillance society. There's a Party Workshirt, Party Chinos, Outer Party Jacket (which I've got my eye on), and an Inner Party Blazer.</p>

<p>But the key to the collection is the UnPocket included with each piece. The UnPocket is a removable sleeve for your mobile device that renders it untrackable, allowing you to "go dark" when you're out and about. The pocket's material and design blocks out all cellular, WiFi, GPS, and RFID signals, effectively rendering your mobile phone invisible to the outside world, your own personal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage">Faraday cage</a>. They're also offering the UnPocket as a separate item for purchase, to slip into your own pocket, purse, or backpack. So <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zoltancsaki/1984-stealth-fashion-for-the-under-surveillance-so">check out the 1984 Kickstarter</a> for details, pricing, and available styles.</p>

<h2><a href="http://kottke.org/14/09/aging-canned-foods">Aging canned foods</a>&ensp  <span class="date">SEP 15</span></h2>

<p>Originally from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1938073460/ref=nosim/0sil8">the sixth issue</a> of the excellent Lucky Peach magazine, mad food scientist Harold McGee of the joys of aging canned food and its "extremely cooked flavor".</p>

<blockquote><p>This punishing heat treatment helps create the distinctive flavors of canned goods. So does the hermetically sealed container, which means that after any preliminary cooking outside the can-tuna is steamed to remove moisture, for example, and the best French sardines are lightly fried-oxygen can play only a limited role in flavor development, and that whatever happens in the can stays in the can-no aromas can escape. Hence the common presence of a sulfurous quality, which may be eggy or meaty or oniony or cabbagy or skunky, from compounds like hydrogen sulfide, various methyl sulfides, and methanethiol. Some of these notes can gradually fade during storage as the volatiles slowly react with other components of the food.</p>

<p>The overall flavor is nothing like freshly cooked foods. Food technologists often refer to it as "retort off-flavor." But it's only off in comparison to the results of ordinary cooking. It's really just another kind of cooked flavor, an extremely cooked flavor, and it can be very good. Canned tuna, sardines, chicken spread, and Spam all have their own appeal.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd,<br />

-- Bruce Springsteen, Growing Up</p>

<p>In the NYT Magazine, A.O. Scott <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/magazine/the-death-of-adulthood-in-american-culture.html">reflects on the death of adulthood in American culture</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>What all of these shows grasp at, in one way or another, is that nobody knows how to be a grown-up anymore. Adulthood as we have known it has become conceptually untenable. It isn't only that patriarchy in the strict, old-school Don Draper sense has fallen apart. It's that it may never really have existed in the first place, at least in the way its avatars imagined. Which raises the question: Should we mourn the departed or dance on its grave?</p></blockquote>

<p>Walter Isaacson has written books on Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, and Steve Jobs. His newest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00JGAS65Q/ref=nosim/0sil8">The Innovators</a>, is due out in early October and focuses on the people who invented computing and the Internet.</p>

<blockquote><p>In his masterly saga, Isaacson begins with Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron's daughter, who pioneered computer programming in the 1840s. He explores the fascinating personalities that created our current digital revolution, such as Vannevar Bush, Alan Turing, John von Neumann, J.C.R. Licklider, Doug Engelbart, Robert Noyce, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs, Tim Berners-Lee, and Larry Page.</p>

<p>This is the story of how their minds worked and what made them so inventive. It's also a narrative of how their ability to collaborate and master the art of teamwork made them even more creative.</p></blockquote>

<p>The analysis of the weak parts of Apple's recent introduction of the iPhone 6 and Apple Watch at the beginning of <a href="http://jiggity.com/steve.html">this piece</a> is good, but the real gem is the complete reworking of the presentation as Steve Jobs might have approached it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Jobs: It's not easy being an engineer at Apple. (Laughs) How do you take the world's best phone and make it even better? (Cheers)</p>

<p>When we first launched the iPhone back in 2007, we didn't anticipate the central role it plays today-how it would touch every part of our lives. (Cheers)</p>

<p>Seven years later, our iPhones are the window to our world. Through this window I see my wife and kids. I see my friends, take care of work, and relax.</p>

<p>If this window is so important, what if we made it a little bigger?</p>

<p>(Steve holds out his hand and starts separating his fingers as if he's stretching an iPhone)</p>

<p>(Once they get really far, he grins and quickly pushes them back together)</p>

<p>Jobs: But not too big! (Audience chuckles) You still want to be able to hold it in one hand and fit it inside your pocket.</p>

<p>Our team of smart engineers have come up with the perfect size.</p></blockquote>

<p>The heartfelt folksiness is pitch perfect. And the whole thing about the iWatch is amazing:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jobs: The iWatch comes with a special sensor that detects your heartbeat. In addition to linking to Apple Health, it does something very special.</p>

<p>Something very dear to me.</p>

<p>I'd like to see how my daughter is doing. Instead of sending her a text, what can I do? I press this button twice, and... (Heartbeats echo in the auditorium)</p>

<p>You can't see it, but my watch is vibrating to her heartbeat. I can close my eyes and know that my daughter is alive, living her life halfway around the globe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not sure if Jobs would have approached it this way, but it made me actually want to get an Apple Watch. (via <a href="https://twitter.com/arainert">@arainert</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>"Oh God," he groans, "Don't even go there. Indiana Jones is not an archeologist."</p>

<p>It's not surprising that academics -- hell bent on taking the fun out of everything -- would hate our beloved and iconic movie version of them. But Canuto is no killjoy. His ironic tone and acerbic wit seem honed by long boring days in the sun. So I bite. I quickly learn that there's a good reason why most every archeologist on Earth hates Indy. And that they might have a point. Because Jones isn't an archeologist at all.</p>

<p>"That first scene, where he's in the temple and he's replacing that statue with a bag of sand -- that's what looters do," Canuto says, grinning. "[The temple builders] are using these amazing mechanisms of engineering and all he wants to do is steal the stupid gold statue."</p></blockquote>

<p>If you're thinking of switching mobile carriers (b/c perhaps a certain fruit company is releasing new models), you should <a href="http://sensorly.com/">check Sensorly</a> for "unbiased" coverage maps of AT&amp T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and even smaller companies like Metro PCS and US Cellular. Looks like the maps are somewhat inaccurate because they rely on contributions only from Sensorly app users. For example, there are large swaths of upper Manhattan and the Bronx which show coverage only along major roads. But still helpful to use beside the companies' official coverage maps.

<p>From an anonymous author on The Frisky, <a href="http://www.thefrisky.com/2014-09-09/why-i-married-my-abuser/">Why I Married My Abuser</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>One Saturday afternoon a few months after our first date, I opened one of the cards and then smelled it as he beamed on proudly. I sniffed and joked "like a woman" because he was the first man I ever knew to send a scented envelope.</p>

<p>I know it's a cliche, but if I close my eyes, I can still see that moment in slow motion. His face changed from beaming to furious. And suddenly, I was on the floor. It wasn't until he extended his hand down to me saying, "Oh baby I am so sorry! Why did you have to say that? I'm so sorry!" that I realized I was on the floor because his fist had put me there. I actually thought for a second that a piece of the ceiling must have fallen down. Surely Hank couldn't have hit me? That was something that happened to other people.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Why did you have to say that?" The insidiousness of that simple phrase is chilling. From Obsidian Wings, the perspective of someone who worked at a battered women's shelter for five years: <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2009/04/why-do-they-stay.html">Why Do They Stay?</a></p>

<blockquote><p>So imagine yourself, in love with someone, on your honeymoon or pregnant, when suddenly this guy just goes ballistic, often for very little reason, and hits you. For a lot of women, this is profoundly shocking and disorienting. There are things that are comprehensible parts of the world, even if they're rare, like having your car stolen  and then there are things that are unexpected in a completely different sense, like having your car turn into an elephant before your eyes: things that make you wonder whether you're completely crazy. Being beaten up by someone who apparently loves you is one of those things.</p>

<p>What this means is that precisely when a woman needs as much confidence in her own judgment as she can muster, the rug is completely pulled out from under her. And it's not just that she questions her judgment because she got involved with this guy in the first place  she questions her judgment because something so completely alien to the world she thinks she knows has just happened.</p></blockquote>

<p>And via the National Domestic Violence Hotline site, Sarah Buel's <a href="http://www.vcpionline.org/pdfs/50%20Reasons%20Why%20Victims%20Stay.pdf">Fifty Obstacles to Leaving, a.k.a., Why Abuse Victims Stay</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>14. Financial Abuse: Financial abuse is a common tactic of abusers, although it may take different forms, depending on the couple's socio-economic status. The batterer may control estate planning and access to all financial records, as well as make all money decisions. Victims report being forced to sign false tax returns or take part in other unlawful financial transactions. Victims also may be convinced that they are incapable of managing their finances or that they will face prison terms for their part in perpetrating a fraud if they tell someone.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since the video of former NFL player Ray Rice knocking his then-fianc&eacute e out in an elevator leaked, the National Domestic Violence Hotline <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/10/ray-rice-domestic-violence-hotline_n_5798462.html">has seen an 84% increase in call volume</a>.

<p>As part of a course he was teaching, a biologist sent away for a genetic testing kit from <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23andMe</a> for himself and his parents. When he went looking for other relatives on the service (which is now an automatic opt-out feature), <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/9/5975653/with-genetic-testing-i-gave-my-parents-the-gift-of-divorce-23andme">he discovered he had a half-brother</a> his dad had not told his family about.</p>

<blockquote><p>At first, I was thinking this is the coolest genetics story, my own personal genetics story. I wasn't particularly upset about it initially, until the rest of the family found out. Their reaction was different. Years of repressed memories and emotions uncorked and resulted in tumultuous times that have torn my nuclear family apart. My parents divorced. No one is talking to my dad. We're not anywhere close to being healed yet and I don't know how long it will take to put the pieces back together.</p>

<p>After this discovery was made, I went back to 23andMe and talked to them. I said, "I'm not sure all your customers realize that when they participate in your family finder program, what they're participating in what are essentially really advanced paternity tests." People find out that their parents aren't who they think they are. They have nearly a million people in the database. If there happens to be anyone in there you're related to, they'll find your match. This is a solid science.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know a family in which one of the children is adopted and they haven't told her. Which is crazy...she's gonna find out eventually (through something like 23andMe or because of some medical emergency or test) and go totally berzerk.</p>

And, while it might sound far-fetched, new research suggests that Rowling's world of house-elves, half-giants and three-headed dogs has the potential to make us nicer people.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've been reading Harry Potter with the kids for awhile now. We're almost finished with The Prisoner of Azkaban. One of my favorite parts of reading it with them is when they're confused about a situation or a particular word and we get to have a conversation. While reading Chamber of Secrets, we talked about mudbloods, prejudice, and fascism. We've talked about good and evil and how many of the books' characters actually possess both good and not-so-good qualities. More recently, we talked about bravery and cowardice in the context of being a friend and how even Neville, who seems frightened of everything, is a brave and true friend for trying to stop Hermione, Ron, and Harry from leaving the Gryffindor common room in search of the Sorcerer's Stone. I don't know if they're better people for it, but I value the chance to have those conversations with them about something they're really into.</p>

<h2><a href="http://kottke.org/14/09/openstreetmap-turns-10">OpenStreetMap turns 10</a>&ensp  <span class="date">SEP 10</span></h2>

<p>In August, the open source mapping project <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/08/ten-years-of-openstreetmap.html">turned 10 years old</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>When the project was begun by Steve Coast in 2004, map data sources were few, and largely controlled by a small collection of private and governmental players. The scarcity of map data ensured that it remained both expensive and highly restrictive, and no one but the largest navigation companies could use map data. Steve changed the rules by creating a wiki-like resource of the entire globe, which everyone could use without hinderance.</p>

<p>The magic of OSM's early success was not just its timeliness -- GPS was becoming affordable, storage was increasingly cheap, and the iPhone was around the corner -- but its provision of a read-write canvas where emerging mapping enthusiasts could convert their frustration into action. Maps, of course, are intimately personal, but also overtly political: as a true, citizens' map of the world, OSM could address that particular paradox -- no longer were mapping resources allocated by revenue potential  instead, all one needed was time and a computer connection to add data about their country or their neighborhood.</p></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, from a fledgling project, <a href="https://mvexel.github.io/thenandnow/#11/34.0137/-118.2809">a rich collection of data</a> has taken shape:</p>

<p>Still my favorite use of OSM: <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/watercolor/#14/40.7303/-73.9832">Stamen's watercolor maps</a>. Happy birthday, old thing.</p>

<p>Apple just announced the iPhone 6 and for the first time, I'm seriously thinking about upgrading my phone before my contract is up. A company called Statista <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/numbers/who-will-pay-the-most-for-your-old-iphone-1723/">recently surveyed several companies who buy old iPhones</a>. It looks like the best place to sell your old iPhone is Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/sell-iphone/b/?_encoding=UTF8&amp camp=1789&amp creative= 0957&amp linkCode=ur2&amp node=5785845011&amp tag=0sil8&amp linkId=UKJIZXMMQAPDUAVF">they're offering Amazon gift cards in the $300-400 range</a> for good-condition iPhone 5s.</p>

<p><a href="http://glyde.com/sell/iphone">Glyde offers slightly less for iPhones</a> than Amazon, but they'll give you cash (although withdrawals take 3-5 business days).

Matt Haughey has <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2014/08/the-eye-fi-mobi-card-is-the-real-deal.html">a review</a> of their newest card, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00CS4WPHC/ref=nosim/0sil8">the Eyefi Mobi</a>, which automagically syncs to your phone, resulting in a 20-second DSLR-to-Instagram workflow.</p>

<blockquote><p>In essence, the card turns any dumb camera into an outboard lens for your phone. Last week on a trip to NYC I took my new compact camera with me and could easily upload photos to Instagram and Twitter within seconds of taking the photos. I mean that literally: I can take a photo with my camera, open up my phone, touch the mobi app icon and about ten seconds later I can be saving that image to my phone's camera roll. I could also manipulate and tweak the images in a plethora of iPhone apps like VSCOcam, Photoshop Express, etc. directly on the phone before sharing it out to the world.</p></blockquote>

<p>This sounds amazing. Step one for me: get a camera. Any suggestions? I've been eyeing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00ATM1MVA/ref=nosim/0sil8">Fujifilm's X100S</a> for quite awhile...</p>

<h2><a href="http://kottke.org/14/09/im-quitting-football">I'm quitting football.</a>&ensp  <span class="date">SEP 09</span></h2>

<p>Life-long NFL football fan Steve Almond recently wrote a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00IW4DOWM/ref=nosim/0sil8">Against Football</a> in which he details why he is no longer watching the game he loves. Ian Crouch <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/quitting-football">talked with Almond for the New Yorker</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Any other year, Steve Almond would have seen the play. But, after forty years of fandom, he's quit the N.F.L. In his new book, "Against Football," Almond is plain about what he considers the various moral hazards of the game: "I happen to believe that our allegiance to football legitimizes and even fosters within us a tolerance for violence, greed, racism, and homophobia."</p></blockquote>

<p>This part resonated most with me:</p>

<blockquote><p>Even a casual N.F.L. fan can recognize that this is a particularly opportune time for a Raiders fan to stop watching football. The team is terrible. I asked Almond about that. "If the Raiders were really good, I might not have written the book," he said. "How fucked up is that? It's true, I love them. I see those colors, and it's me." For Almond, his struggle to confront his own hypocrisy is exactly the point: proof of football's insidiousness, of its ominous power.</p>

<p>"Football somehow hits that Doritos bliss point," he told me. "It's got the intellectual allure of all these contingencies and all this strategy, but at the same time it is so powerfully connecting us to the intuitive joys of childhood, that elemental stuff: Can you make a miracle? Can you see the stuff that nobody else sees? And most of us can't, but we love to see it. And I don't blame people for wanting to see it. I love it, and I'm going to miss it."</p></blockquote>

<p>I've been a steadfast fan of NFL football for the past 15 years. Most weekends I'd catch at least two or three games on TV. Professional football lays bare all of the human achievement + battle with self + physical intelligence + teamwork stuff I love thinking about in a particularly compelling way. But for a few years now, the cons have been piling up in my conscience: <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/9745797/new-book-league-denial-says-nfl-used-resources-power-two-decades-deny-football-link-brain-damage">the response to head injuries</a>, <a href="http://beyondchron.org/how-the-nfl-fleeces-taxpayers/">the league's nonprofit status</a>, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2183720-michael-sam-not-being-signed-on-the-media-excuse-making-and-homophobia">the</a> <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11375100/chris-kluwe-minnesota-vikings-reach-settlement-avert-lawsuit">homophobia</a>, and <a href="http://kottke.org/13/01/pain-is-routine-in-the-nfl">turning a blind eye to the reliance on drugs</a> (PEDs and otherwise). And the final straw: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh1x1-Z91sU">the awful terrible inhuman way the league treats violence against women</a>.</p>

<p>It's overwhelming. Enough is enough. I dropped my cable subscription a few months ago and was considering getting it again to watch the NFL, but I won't be doing that. Pro football, I love you, but we can't see each other anymore. And it's definitely you, not me. Call me when you grow up.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Chuck Klosterman recently tackled (*groan*) this issue in the NY Times Magazine: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/magazine/is-it-wrong-to-watch-football.html">Is It Wrong to Watch Football?</a></p>

<blockquote><p>My (admittedly unoriginal) suspicion is that the reason we keep having this discussion over the ethics of football is almost entirely a product of the sport's sheer popularity. The issue of concussions in football is debated exhaustively, despite the fact that boxing -- where the goal is to hit your opponent in the face as hard as possible -- still exists. But people care less about boxing, so they worry less about the ethics of boxing. Football is the most popular game in the United States and generates the most revenue, so we feel obligated to worry about what it means to love it. Well, here's what it means: We love something that's dangerous. And I can live with that.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ta-Nehisi Coates <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/05/junior-seau-is-dead/256664/">quit watching back in 2012</a> after Junior Seau died.</p>

<blockquote><p>I'm not here to dictate other people's morality. I'm certainly not here to call for banning of the risky activities of consenting adults. And my moral calculus is my own. Surely it is a man's right to endanger his body, and just as it is my right to decline to watch. The actions of everyone in between are not my consideration.</p></blockquote>

<p>Same here. I don't feel any sense of judgment or righteousness about this. Just the personal loss of a hobby I *really* enjoyed.
