Jorge Ramos delivered an emotional and powerful speech Tuesday night at the 2014 Committee to Protect Journalists International Press Freedom Awards.Ramos was the recipient of theBurton Benjamin Memorial Award, given for "lifetime achievement in defending press freedom."Ramos pointed to a quote by the great Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel to bring his point home: “We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.”In closing, Ramos dedicated his award to all the journalists who have died in Syria and Mexico, including two U.S. journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, earlier this year."You were our eyes. Now you are part of our soul," Ramos concluded.See photos below:CNN's Christiane Amanpour presented the award.My friendpresents BB Award to the most influential journalist in America— Isaac Lee (@isaacleep)Awards - Committee to Protect JournalistsCPJ Honors Univision's Ramos | BroadcastingCableJorge Ramos, galardonado por el Comité para la Protección de los PeriodistasUnivision's Jorge Ramos: 'Obama is Paying a Debt to the Latino Community'
