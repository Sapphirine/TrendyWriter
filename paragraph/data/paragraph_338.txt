And he should know.I am the guy who has created about 173 of the national food holidays we celebrate today,says the Birmingham, Alabama-based social media consultant who operates the hobby site. While many of the food holidays he tracksNational Indian Pudding Day(November 13) toNational Doughnut Day(first Friday of June)were already in existence, he wanted to fete at least one type of food, dish, or cuisine for each day of the year. So, he made some upFrog Legson Leap Day.To make up a holiday, Hopkins says it's a matter of just putting it out there and doing some coordinated marketing around the day.If Im on Twitter and I have 850,000 followers and I get 100 or 150 retweets for a national day post, in the Google database, that day exists,says Hopkins.Next year, that day is that day.The question is, how do you turn your holiday into a payday?

After all, asmall business is hardly in the same league as American Express and Alibaba.Anyone can attempt to start a day and if it catches on, great,But it takes a lot of years for this to catch on. Singles Day may be an exception to the rule.Ultimately, you need to consider what your goals are, suggests Anderson.

A case in point: Retail analystpredicts that Black Friday will fall to No. 3 in sales, after the Saturday before Christmas (December 20) and the day after Christmas.What's Black Friday's malady? A deadly disease called "semantic satiationWhen Black Friday described something specificthe day after Thanksgiving when you risked being trampled to score that 50-inch TVIf you're in the retail business, this matters because "Black Friday" will become less and less effective as a term that lures shoppers.If you're not in retail, you should also care. There are many terms that are effective for while, but quickly become overused to the point of meaning nothing. (Paradigm, I'm looking at you.)While it's difficult to resist the temptation to jump on the bandwagon, the way you get attention is by sounding different than everyone else.For example, here's Wal-Mart's U.S.chief merchantDuncan MacNaughton: "It used to be called Black Friday, then it became Thursday, now it's a week long. Maybe we should just call it November."Black Friday, RIP.Organic Thanksgiving Was Worth the Extra CostNov. 26 2014 2:59 PMThis Thanksgiving,of Americans will slide back from their dinner tables, get in their cars, and head for a postprandial shopping trip to snap up deals at a holiday sale.Please, please do not be one of those peopleboth for your own sake, and out of respect for the retail staff who get dragooned into coming to work on a day they should have off with family.I know. Complaining about our mania for holiday bargain-hunting, and that Black Friday now begins on Brown Thursday, is already a bit of a clich. Progressive-minded writers seem to spend every November lamenting the misfortune of employees forced to show up to their job on Thanksgiving. The econ bloggers athave practically devotedan entire monthof coverage to the subject. Meanwhile, stores like Costco, Crate and Barrel, and Marshallsnow bragabout the fact that theyopen on our national day of gluttony as a way of painting themselves as family-friendly.But it bears repeating. Thanksgiving shopping, as it currently stands, is an awful tradition that should be boycotted.To start, Black Friday (and its Thursday lead-in) is a bit of a sham. Yes, some of those cut-rate flat-screen TVs are a real steal. But, as theWall Street Journalexplained last year, many of the supposedly great deals are acarefully engineered illusion.Retailers regularly mark down merchandise from heavily inflated prices to trick shoppers into believing theyre getting a bargain. Meanwhile, prices oftendrop furtheras the holiday season progresses and stores try to clear out inventory, and better deals can sometimes be found atother times of the year. Plus, in binge-shopping over Thanksgiving weekend,behavioral psychology suggestsre pretty much dooming yourself to overspend, including on full-price items that just happen to be sitting next to those marked-down toaster ovens.In short, those who shop on Thanksgiving are practically begging to be fleeced.the only richnation where workers arent guaranteed paid vacations or holidays, which is why companies like Walmart, which has stayed open on every Thanksgivingsince 1988, can ask their staff to come in whether they want to or not. If we had a humane national vacation policy, none of this would be an issue.But we dont. And so retailers are mostly free to keep whatever hours they choose, and demand their workforce deal with it. Some companies, likeKmart, do say they offer their staff bonus pay for working Thanksgiving (though exactly how much, in Walmarts case,is a bit of a question). But in some cases, workers dont have any choice but to clock in.Kmart employees, for instance, say theyve been told they could lose their jobs or be otherwise punished if they dont come in. Target workers are also reportedly not allowed to ask fortime off works especially galling about this is that early Thanksgiving day sales donnecessarily benefitthe retail industry as a whole. Instead, theyre the product of a massive collective action problem. Opening up on Thursday doesnt increase sales overall. But companies are worried that if they dont, their customers will simply do their shopping elsewhere.Retailers are trying to get a jump on the competition,Bill Martin of mall-traffic tracker ShopperTraklast yearThursday is simply selling the stuff at the expense of Black Friday.Many of the stores that do choose to stay closed on Thanksgiving, like Neiman Marcus, Sams Club, Costco, and Crate and Barrel cater to somewhat wealthier clientele and dont rely on massive markdowns to court customers. They have the luxury of sitting out of the competition. But we cant rationally expect big-box stores like Best Buy, Walmart, and Kmart that cater to the cash-strapped middle class to do the same.We could try to solve this problem with regulation. Massachusetts, Maine, and Rhode Island ban stores from opening on Thanksgiving. A state lawmaker in Ohiohas introduced a billthat would force stores to pay employees triple wages for working on the holiday and allow them to take the day off without facing retaliation.t fall for it.*Correction, Nov. 26, 2014:This post originally misspelled the name of retailer JcPenney.Nov. 26 2014 1:42 PMThe iPhone 6 has already carried Apple to arecord-breaking quarterand on Tuesday led the company to an unprecedented$700 billion valuation.
