I didn't get into journalism to write about Brett Favre's private parts, and I suspect most of my colleagues would like that story ruled out of bounds.Amid a deluge of angry e-mails, one reader wrote:I used to visit your site for sports but now consider it to be on par with the National Enquirer.But it was the Enquirer that broke the Tiger Woods scandal, which involved a lot more than phone flirting and has mired the golfer's career in a sand trap.if there is a way to expose this dude for the creepy [jerk] he is WITHOUT me being attached to it in any way that is fine.But he decided to attach her to it anyway, as well as publish their private correspondence, and that feels like a betrayal.Daulerio says in an interview that he wasvery transparentabout what happened with Sterger:She was 100 percent on board about exposing Brett Favre in this way. She didn't want her name attached because she feared the backlash.Still, he admits he was unfair to Sterger.Even in publishing what it called thepenis photos(the headline used a much cruder term), Deadspin acknowledged thatyes, there's a possibility that the person communicating with Jenn was not actually Brett Favre, but rather someone trying very hard toto be him.In other words, Deadspin ran a story that might be untrue.There was no real hesitation about pulling the trigger, but I knew there was a remote, remote possibility this was orchestrated by someone impersonating Brett Favre,Daulerio says. Asked about criticism of his methods, he tells detractors to perform an anatomically impossible act, adding:It's obviously been a worthwhile investment,Daulerio says. He sounds less than comfortable, though, conceding thatit's kind of shady. But I was very, very eager to get this story.Little wonder, then, that Deadspin has been getting such e-mails asi have 2 topless pictures of katie perry. . . . i am trying to sell them.Just drag and dropthis linkonto the Home icon in your browser.
