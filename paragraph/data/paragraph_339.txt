She didn't want her name attached because she feared the backlash.Still, he admits he was unfair to Sterger.Even in publishing what it called thepenis photos(the headline used a much cruder term), Deadspin acknowledged thatyes, there's a possibility that the person communicating with Jenn was not actually Brett Favre, but rather someone trying very hard toto be him.In other words, Deadspin ran a story that might be untrue.There was no real hesitation about pulling the trigger, but I knew there was a remote, remote possibility this was orchestrated by someone impersonating Brett Favre,Daulerio says. Asked about criticism of his methods, he tells detractors to perform an anatomically impossible act, adding:It's obviously been a worthwhile investment,Daulerio says. He sounds less than comfortable, though, conceding thatit's kind of shady. But I was very, very eager to get this story.Little wonder, then, that Deadspin has been getting such e-mails asi have 2 topless pictures of katie perry. . . . i am trying to sell them.The owner of this website (www.nakedcapitalism.com) has banned your access based on your browser's signature (190fb1db719d040c-ua48).
