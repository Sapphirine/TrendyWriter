But that isn’t the most recent six-year period covered by government data, and it also doesn’t reflect Obama’s time in office.The Department of Homeland Security hasfiscal 2014 preliminary data for Southwest border apprehensionsbased on DHS’ preliminary numbers. That’s a 32 percent drop.The available statistics also contradict Obama’s claim about child apprehensions.The number of unaccompanied children being apprehended at the Southwest border has increased annually since fiscal year 2012,according to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Infiscal 2014, there were 68,541 UAC apprehensions,which is a 77 percent increase from fiscal 2013 and a 181 percent increase from fiscal 2012.As the president said, thelarge increase in 2014 was due to a temporary spikethat began in March and ended in June. And most recently,in October 2014, there were 2,529 apprehensions of unaccompanied children. That is lower than the figure of 2,986 apprehensions in February 2013, which was nearly two years ago.Santorum on the Foreign-BornSantorum, a former andpossible futureRepublican presidential candidate, made his misleading claim onNov. 23 on CNN’s “State of the Union.”Santorum, Nov. 23:The foreign-born made up a higher percentage of the U.S. population from 1860 to 1920.U.S. Census figures309 million people in 2010. Back in 1890, the foreign-born population was 9.2 million out of a total population ofabout 63 millionAudrey SingerTwo chartsfrom Singer’s 2013 paper “Contemporary Immigration Gateways in Historical Perspective” show the change in the foreign-born population and growth rates since 1860.With the recent recession, immigration has slowed. The Organisation for Economic Development and Co-operationpublished a report in 2011showing that legal, permanent immigration to the U.S. had risen just 2 percent in fiscal year 2009, but 5 percent the previous year.Census data from 2013show the foreign-born population has inched up by about 1.3 million from 2010 to 41.3 million. That’s now 13.1 percent of population, compared with 12.9 percent three years earlier.The number of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally has plateaued, with the number hovering around 11.3 million since 2009,according to estimates from the Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends ProjectSantorum also claimed that “what the president is saying is, ‘We need more [immigrants].’” But Obama’sexecutive actionsto grant temporary reprieves from deportation pertain to those who have lived in the country continuously since Jan. 1, 2010, not recent or future immigrants.Immigration reform would reduce the federal deficit by  36 2.5 trillion over the next 10 years, according to an April analysis by the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank.Immigrants are more than twice as likely than native-born Americans to start new businesses, according to a White House report on immigration reform.Immigration reform would boost GDP by  36 1.5 trillion -- or about 1 percent -- over 10 years, according to an estimate from UCLA professor Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda cited by CNBC.Businesses owned by immigrants created 4.7 million jobs in the U.S. in 2007, according to a White House report on immigration reform.
