Mary Landrieu and GOP U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy could make it nine seats.The new Senate line-up is 53 Republicans, 46 Democrats, including two independents that caucus with the Democrats, and one undecided race.The 36 Governors races on the ballot this cycle were supposed to provide Democrats with a silver lining on election night.For much of the cycle, they looked poised to pick up between two and four seats since Republicans had to defend governorships in states President Obama carried easily in 2012.But, Republican incumbents ran very solid races, while Democrats struggled to hold their some of their open seats, including two in very blue states.In the end, Republicans actually picked up seats, defeating Gov. Pat Quinn in Illinois and winning open seats in Arkansas, Maryland, and Massachusetts.The GOP lost Pennsylvania, where Gov. Tom Corbett was running for a second term, and the results of Gov. Sean Parnell's re-election bid in Alaska are pending.The new line up of the nation’s Governors is 31 Republicans and 17 Democrats, with the outcome of two races pending (Alaska and Vermont).Amy Walter, National EditorThe 2014 Partisan Voting IndexSince 1997, theCook Political ReportSee Chart »Read More »In the latest issue of the Rhodes Cook Letter, Rhodes looks back at the 2014 primary season.
