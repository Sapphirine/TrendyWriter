NEW YORK (AP) — Early-bird shoppers headed to stores on Thanksgiving in what's becoming a new holiday tradition.In the Chicago suburb of Naperville, Illinois, the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store was full roughly 30 minutes before Thanksgiving deals started at 6 p.m., including $199 iPad minis.In New York City, there were 500 people in line by the time a Target store in the East Harlem neighborhood opened at 6 p.m.And 200 people rushed in at the Toys R Us in New York City's Times Square when it opened at 5 p.m."I'm going to try to avoid the crowds," said Smalls, who plans to spend $300 to $400 on gifts this year.The National Retail Federation expects 25.6 million shoppers to take advantage of the Thanksgiving openings, down slightly from last year."That's why they keep doing it," he said. "You have to be first.""It's a tradition," said Wilkinson. "I look forward to it."On Wilkinson's shopping list? A 40-inch TV for $119, headphones for $97 and pajamas for $5.Not every store was open on Thanksgiving, though. Some, including GameStop, Costco and Ikea, said they wouldn't open because they want their workers to enjoy the holiday.Mae Anderson in New York and Sara Burnett in Chicago contributed to the report.Follow Anne D'Innocenzio at www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzioThanksgiving store hours spark Black Friday backlash - CBS NewsBlack Friday will start earlier on Thanksgiving - NY Daily NewsBlack Friday is now the real star of Thanksgiving | New York PostBlack Friday (shopping) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaBargain hunters line up for Black Friday deals on ThanksgivingBlack Friday deals still entice some shoppers to wait hours on ThanksgivingThought Thanksgiving was about coming together with family and being grateful for what you have?
