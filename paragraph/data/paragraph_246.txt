He died in September 2005, still chief justice.As for the next presidential election, she has said on more than one occasion, "I am hopeful about 2016."In an October interview in The New Yorker magazine, Obama said Ginsburg was "doing a wonderful job.""She is one of my favorite people," Obama told the magazine. "Life tenure means she gets to decide, not anybody else, when she chooses to go."Associated Press writers Nancy Benac and Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report.Serving since: Sept. 29, 2005Serving since: Sept. 26, 1986Serving since: Feb. 18, 1988Serving since: Oct. 23, 1991Serving since: Aug. 10, 1993Serving since: Aug. 3, 1994Serving since: Jan. 31, 2006Serving since: Aug. 8, 2009Serving since: Aug. 7, 2010
