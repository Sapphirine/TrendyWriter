Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson opened up for the first time in aninterview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, part of which aired Tuesday evening, less than 24 hours after it was announced a grand jurywould not indicthim for the death of Michael Brown.Stephanopoulos: “What did you think when you saw that?”Wilson: “I didn’t know, I mean, my initial thought was, is there a weapon in there?”Stephanopoulos: “Even though he hadn’t pulled something out earlier when he was confronting you.”Wilson: “Yeah, it was still just the unknown. And again, we’re taught to, let me see your hands.”Stephanopoulos: “As you know, some of the eyewitnesses have said, when at that moment he turned around, he turned around and put his hands up.”Wilson: “That would be incorrect. Incorrect.”Stephanopoulos: “No way?”Wilson: “No way.”Stephanopoulos: “So, you say he starts to run, does a [unintelligible], starts to come toward you.”Wilson: “Mmm hmm.”Stephanopoulos: “And?”George: “Even though he’s what, 35-40 feet away?”Wilson: “Once he’s coming that direction, why, if he hasn’t stopped yet, when’s he gonna stop?”Wilson said he has a "clean conscience" about the way he handled the incident with Brown.“I don’t think it’s haunting. It’s always going to be something that happened," Wilson said."The reason I have a clean conscience is because I know I did my job right," Wilson added.Asked whether he felt remorse for killing Brown, Wilson said that "everyone feels remorse when life's lost."Wilson said that the most important thing people should know about him is that he was acting professionally during the interaction with Brown.Wilson has been keeping a low profile since he shot and killed Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black teenager, in Missouri on Aug. 9. Wilson's lawyersreleased a statementStephanopoulosthe interview earlier Tuesday, saying there was "no question off limits."A few days before, it was reported that Wilson had beenmeeting with network anchorsin anticipation of giving an interview after the announcement of the grand jury's decision.
