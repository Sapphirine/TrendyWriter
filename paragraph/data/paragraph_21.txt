Shear decided to conduct her research, which will be published soon in the TheoryResearch in Social Education, after teaching a class of undergraduate students studying education at the University of Missouri and realizing they knew relatively little about the histories of indigenous peoples.According to Shear, state standards tend to provide an uncomplicated version of U.S. history in regard to indigenous peoples, leaving out the more unsavory aspects of colonialism.In all, Shear said, the standards allow students to graduate from the K-12 system with little understanding of what contemporary Native American culture and life looks like.Ultimately, Shear said, her students at the University of Missouri were just as frustrated as she was about the education they received regarding indigenous peoples.Earlier on HuffPost:In a veto message issued Friday, Christie called the bill opposing gestation crates a "solution in search of a problem.""It is a political movement masquerading as substantive policy," he said."Obviously, the governor is putting his personal political ambitions ahead of the humane treatment of animals," he said.The fight over the legislation had become one of the most heated in recent memory.The National Pork Producers Council, based in Washington, D.C., sent a lobbyist to New Jersey to try to scuttle the attempt.
