Director of Mentoring USA/Purpose Driven/Champion of Change/Community Healer/Positive Opportunity BrokerBy Mehreen Zahra-MalikA court sentenced Mir Shakeel-ur-Rehman, owner of Geo News,  on Tuesday over a broadcast showing people dancing to a song  about the wedding of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad's daughter.The channel faced a slew of blasphemy complaints about the  show, provoking accusations that the country's punitive  blasphemy law was being used to silence critics of the military.The channel's owner, the host of the morning show and two  guests were ordered to pay fines of $16,600, surrender their  passports and sell their properties.The order is unlikely to be implemented because verdicts by  courts in the northern Gilgit-Baltistan region do not apply to  the rest of Pakistan.The News, a daily newspaper owned by ur-Rehman, announced on  its front page on Wednesday that it would appeal to the Supreme  Court against both the verdict and sentence.Pakistani media has become increasingly free and vocal in  recent years but public criticism of the army or the ISI is  still largely taboo.In June, the state media regulator shut Geo News for 15 days  and imposed a $101,500 fine. The channel also publicly  apologized for reporting against the ISI.Pakistan's blasphemy law allows anyone to file a complaint  alleging their religious feelings have been hurt for any reason.  The punishment for blasphemy is death.Veena Malik Sentenced to 26 Years in Jail for Blasphemy in PakistanPakistan: Geo TV owner, actress Veena Malik sentenced to 26 years in jail for ...Veena Malik and husband sentenced to 26 years in jail in PakistanPakistani court awards 26-year jail to actress Veena Malik, Geo tv ownerJamie JosephWriter and Environmental Activist, savingthewild.comCliff HsiaWriter, Creator of LiveFamilyTravel.comHibaaq OsmanFounder, KaramaPhilip SeibProfessor, University of Southern CaliforniaGeri SpielerInvestigative journalist, research director and Internet research teacherBy Tim Hanstad, President and CEO, Landesa
