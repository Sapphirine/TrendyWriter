I still remember watching Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Senate confirmation hearings and thinking, damn, she's good.But these are more troubled times. It is odd to think the fate of the nation may hang on the 81 year-old Ginsburg staying for now right where she is.might agreelook betterfor Democrats:As Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsay GrahamIn the meantime, good health to you, Notorious R.B.G.Undercover Blue11/29/2014 06:00:00 AMFriday, November 28, 2014When geniuses had to be nunsby digbygo far beyond the saintly or mysticalShe wrote theological, botanical and medicinal texts, as well as letters, liturgical songs, and poems, while supervising miniature illuminations in the Rupertsberg manuscript of her first work, Scivias.She was obviously an amazing person of great intellect and talent. The litany of her accomplishments, religious, literary, musical, scientific is truly astonishing.Perhaps everyone knows about her and have heard her sublime music a thousand times.  But if, like me, you were unaware, here's one Hildegard of Bingen's greatest hits. Enjoy:11/28/2014 06:30:00 PMDemocracy in actionHere's a shocker.Researchers at Duke University have developed a mathematical model that shows how changes in North Carolina’s congressional voting districts could affect election outcomes.During the 2012 elections in North Carolina, Republicans took nine of the state’s 13 U.S. House seats although 51 percent of the two-party vote went to Democratic candidates.Here'a the punchline: the researchers say they hope this will bolster calls for redistricting reform. Yeah, that'll happen.Still, it's another great illustration of how our "democracy" works in practice.  I wonder how people explain this to kids?11/28/2014 05:00:00 PMSouthern Democrats turn left?I saw this headline and inwardly groaned thinking oh boy, here we go, another piece about how the Democrats have to move right.Southern Democrats Urge A Return To Party BasicsBut it isn't that at all:I'd say it's worth a try anyway.  It's certainly better than Blue Dogism which was all about being business friendly and obsessive about taxes.I did think this was sort of funny though:11/28/2014 03:30:00 PMOpen Carry advocates down with the copsWhat could go wrong?About two dozen people took part Wednesday night chanting "No justice, no peace" among other things as they protested police treatment of African-Americans.The open carry advocates said they respected the marchers' right to protest but decided to show up to protect private property.Luckily, nothing went wrong there. It was just three yokels playing cops and robbers. But Jesus, that's just nuts.I wonder what the right wingers would have said if the cops had harassed these guys, roughed them up ---shot them because they felt scared?11/28/2014 02:00:00 PMIs "kill or be killed" replacing t"o protect and to serve"Here's another person making the case thatyou should be able to shoot unarmed people if they scare you. He is one of the editors of Red State,via TPM:Remember, Mike Brown did not have a gun with which to kill Darren Wilson. He didn't have any weapons at all.Let's just say it's a little hard to to believe that he meant that he would have shot Brown "right in the face"while he was allegedly charging at him.His original tweet pretty clearly meant he would have shot Brown in the face while sitting in the police cruiser.I wrote earlierabout the fact that a whole lot of Americans have adopted the belief that they have a right to shoot any unarmed person "right in the face"if theyNow it's obviously different for a police officer who is paid to confront scary people and protect society from them.But they too used to have an obligation not to shoot unarmed people in the face.What you're talking about are the rules ofwhere a soldier in a war zone is charged with killing the enemy and the enemy is charged with killing him. It's kill or be killed.As for that Red State editor, it turns out that he's a puerile fellow with delusions of grandeur:11/28/2014 12:30:00 PMGuess who's starting to worry about labor protests?Just check this out first:Read on to find out who's behind that puerile piece of garbage:The presentation offered questions for the group, including: “How Aggressive Can We Be?” and “How do We Challenge the Social Justice Narrative?”11/28/2014 11:00:00 AMGo for it boysSteve Benen caught11/28/2014 09:30:00 AMThe #Ferguson #failEugene Robinson this morning does moreof the #Ferguson #fail. Robinson calls out the police, for treating the citizens of Ferguson more like "subjects," and Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch for not acting like one:The way McCulloch conducted the grand jury probe wasanything but ordinaryIn his rambling, self-justifying news conference announcing theno-indictment decisionTwo things stand out.First, prosecutors made a point of.) The jury believed the latter.Second, prosecutors walked Wilson through his account, mostly just prompting him to continue. They asked few, if any, probing, challenging, or clarifying questions. His account went unchallenged.The Guardian weighed in yesterday on the conduct of Ferguson-area officials in the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting inThe five leaders who failed FergusonWhile other officials were conceding that they had a problem, Knowlestold MSNBC in late August: “There’s not a racial divide in the city of Ferguson. That is the perspective of all residents in our city. Absolutely.” He would later say in November thathe “absolutely” regretted the remarks, which were roundly dismissed by residents and protesters.BTW: The photo atop Robinson'sshows a friend, aNavy vet11/28/2014 06:00:00 AMThursday, November 27, 2014LeftoversSome soup for you!1 tablespoon olive oil2 medium onions, chopped8 cloves garlic, minced1/3 cup tomato paste3 tablespoons chili powder1 teaspoon dried oregano4 cans (14.5 ounces each) reduced-sodium chicken broth4 cans (15 ounces each) white hominy, drained (You can substitute corn if you prefer)6 3/4 cups shredded cooked turkey meat (2 pounds)Coarse salt and ground pepperAssorted garnishes, such as diced avocado, thinly sliced radishes, and crumbled tortilla chips (optional)Add 4 cups water, broth, and hominy.

Episode 3 Analysisby SpockoEpisode 3 of The Newsroom deals with a Snowden-like leak to a TV journalist. I wonder, how would a mainstream TV network actually handle a story like this? Spoilers below.ACN newsroom is raided by FBI to find leak source.The big issues The Newsroom dealt with in episode three include:US Government possibly charging a journalist with espionageSnowden-like revelations about the government's role in riot deathsProtecting the Snowden-like source's identityA Bezos-like billionaires possibly buying a TV news networkThis episode also had multiply eye rolling moments:Awkward relationship conversations between several men and women.An awkward business conversation between a rich nerd and old school news executiveOf the interesting parts the Snowden-like revelations all seemed familiar. Then I figured out why. I had recently watchedCitizenfourLaura PoitrasSorkin is trying to show how a TV network might act if they got a Snowden-like story. It has all the components:Idealistic young journalist who does the right thingCynical famous news anchor tried to reclaim his young idealistic selfHyper-competent producer with integrityNetwork news management backing the news--until the bill comes dueCorporate Lawyers lawyering.A government bully who waves the "national security" flag at every turnSnowden-like character pushing the timetableBut the current reality is that those crazy ideasare alreadybeing implemented, butthe craziest idea is no longer even brought upIt's now the standard.News needs to make money. But what if the news division wasn't a profit center?They get to lose 110 million dollars a yearEVERY YEAR.Sorkin's fantasy network reminds us what pressures the TV networks face, what principles they say they believe in and explores how they might act when those principles are tested.Photo credit.

Elizabeth Warren is strongly opposed to Obama nominee Antonio Weiss for an under-secretary position at Treasury. She delineated herobjections here(my emphases throughout):Enough Is Enough: The President's Latest Wall Street NomineeI believe President Obama deserves deference in picking his team, and 
I've generally tried to give him that. But enough is enough.So who is Antonio Weiss? He's the head of global investment banking for thefinancial giant Lazard. He has spent the last 20 years of his career at Lazard -- most of it advising on international mergers and acquisitions. ...And Weiss  was right there, working on Burger King's tax deal. ...In recent years,President Obama has repeatedly turned to nominees with close Wall Street tiesfor high-level economic positions ... Enough is enough.My commentWeiss is Money-to-the-core — the billionaire's next nominee for Treasury
 — so he'll get Republican Yes votes. But he's Obama's nominee, so he'll
 draw Republican No's as well.If the nominationIt will indeed take courage for a Democratic senator to oppose both Wall Street and the White House. Do you wonder what happens next? This.The pushback has startedAnd now the pushback starts. On the pages of theNY Times Dealbook, editor Andrew Ross SorkinSenator Elizabeth Warren’s Misplaced Rage at Obama’s Treasury NomineeShe said she wasfurious that the president would nominate someone from Wall Street. 
“It’s time for the Obama administration to loosen the hold that Wall 
Street banks have over economic policy-making,” shewrote on The Huffington PostIt is rare to see suchferocious oppositionto a nominee for a deputy position in the Treasury
 Department. It israrer still when the objection comes from within the 
administration’s own partyYet Ms.Warren’s wrathis misdirected, and herunderstanding of the so-called inversion dealon which she bases much of her oppositionappears misinformed. On these 
issues, as she might say, “Enough is enough.”I'll let youread and decidefor yourself if Sorkin's mitigation is mitigating enough, or if it even addresses the issues Warren raises. But as you do, also consider this, from the same article:He [Weiss] has been a staunch supporter — andcampaign donation bundler— for 
President Obama and is consideredrelatively progressive, especially by 
Wall Street standardsSorkin's piece contains a lot to unpackage. First, go back tomy earlier pieceor toWarren'sIn recent years, President Obama has repeatedly turned to nominees with  close Wall Street ties for high-level economic positions.oversees Dodd-Frank implementation and a wide range of banking and economic policymaking issues, including consumer protection.As Warren said, Weiss is unqualified by background, both specific (his job history) and general (his industry)."Just like a woman"Warren has "rage" (from the headline no less).She's "furious" and "ferocious".She's motivated by "wrath".She "reserves a special rage" for the Burger King deal (from an unquoted part).She's "to put it politely, mistaken".So unpackaging — "to put it politely" white male Wall Street reporter andDealbookIt's not just the attack  it's the defense of WeissAn Obama bundler, and"Relatively" progressive "by Wall Street standards"invest in the wreckage. Big difference.)In my book, that "praise" earns an immediate No, even before I read Warren'scarefully arguedSo why did Sorkin write a defense of Weiss?I can't peek into Andrew Ross Sorkin's heart. But if his goal is to get Weiss nominated, it plays out like this:2. Sorkin makes it obvious thesupports the Weiss nomination. The Times is the "liberal" voice of the

The most important question isthe war worked against her although it doesn't seem to be hindering her at the moment.)Just so there's no confusion about the outcome of this particular process, Rand Paul's plan is to have congress declare war on ISIS:“No. 1: Always go to Congress. We can’t do things unilaterally. This used to be the president’s position in 2007, when he ran for office.”So there you have it. But at least the "process" will have followed.
