And in return, "[The National Enquirer] would not print the story of -- print Beth's story."Cosby's statements, obtained by The New York Times and Associated Press, cameduring a deposition for a civil lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand, who claimed Cosby drugged and assaulted her.According to the Times, Cosby admitted in the previously sealed court documents that he believed if the public knew about Ferrier's allegations, it would give more validity to Constand's claims:"Exactly,‚Äù he replied.Robin Mizrahi, a senior reporter for The National Enquirer who was tasked with the Ferrier story,revealed last week to The Guardian that the tabloid spiked the pieceunder pressure from the actor's lawyers. A new article,which featured an interview with Cosbyin which he discussed allegations made against him by Constand and a woman namedTamara Green, was published instead.Cosby was quoted as saying in the 2005 piece. "I am not going to give in to people who try to exploit me because of my celebrity status."said in a statement to the AP on Wednesdaythat the tabloid was "unflinching" in its coverage of the allegations against the actor.Cosby has a long history with The National Enquirer. On Monday,Page Six's Richard Johnsonrelayed claims from a former Enquirer reporter who saidCosby leaked a 1989 story about his daughter's drug problem. In exchange, the paper buried another story about Cosby allegedly "swinging with Sammy Davis Jr. and some showgirls in Las Vegas."In 1997, theEnquirer offered a $100,000 reward for information on the death of Cosby's son, Ennis Cosby. According to a 1998 New York Times article about the conviction of Ennis Cosby's killer, thetabloid received a tip from a man named Christopher So, who would go on to be one of the key witnesses in the caseTwo years later, Cosbythreatened to sue the magazine for $250 millionafter it ran a storyclaiming Cosby had sexually assaulted an actressnamed Lachele Covington in his Manhattan townhouse."The story is not true. It did not happen,"Brokaw said in a statement to the New York Post. "Mr. Cosby was not contacted by the police and the first he learned about this was from the National Enquirer.""The Enquirer has an absolute right to report on this controversy and will not be intimidated by Mr. Cosby's threat,"Enquirer publisher David J. Pecker said in a statement at the time. "Should Mr. Cosby bring a lawsuit, the Enquirer will seek appropriate sanctions against him."For more,head to the New York TimesNicole Kidman attended the Agon Channel launch party in Milan, Italy on Nov. 26.Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield held hands as they walked home after eating lunch together on Nov. 25 in New York City.Angelina Jolie posed with Chelsea pensioners and a sailor as she arrived in Leicester Square for the Premiere of "Unbroken," which she directed, in London on Nov. 25.Sophia Bush left the gym wearing Zumba Wear pants and sneakers in Los Angeles on Nov. 24.Katharine McPhee tried on a wine-dyed Robert Mondavi Vintner‚Äôs Shirt in Los Angeles on Nov. 24.Selena Gomez stunned at the 2014 American Music Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California on Nov. 23.Taylor Swift was seen leaving a studio before heading over to Fred Segal to do some shopping in West Hollywood, California on Nov. 22.Lorde posed with her awards at the 2014 New Zealand Music Awards at Vector Arena on November 20.Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner looked glamorous at the 2nd annual Save the Children Illumination Gala in New York on November 19,.Kim Kardashian wore a bubblegum pink latex dress to promote her new fragrance at a Spice Market event on November 18, 2014 in Melbourne, Australia.Molly Sims goes shopping in Los Angeles on Nov. 17.Benedict Cumberbatch posed with a penguin at the "Penguins of Madagascar" New York premiere on Nov. 16.Kat Graham teamed up with Pizza Hut to surprise the town of Bland, MO, as part of the pizza company‚Äôs "Flavor of Now" menu launch on Nov. 15.Cheryl Burke and James Maslow were at Light Nightclub in Las Vegas to record iHeartRadio's #MeltingPot on Nov. 14.Jennifer Aniston posed at a photo call for "Horrible Bosses 2" in London on Nov. 13.Portia de Rossi at The Paley Center for Media‚Äôs 2014 LA Benefit Gala presented by Honey Maid, celebrating LGBT equality in media on Nov. 13.Emmy Rossum celebrated mobile filmmaking with Motorola at the Moto X Film Experience premiere event in Los Angeles on Nov. 13.Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio posed together at the the Victoria's Secret Dream Angels Fantasy Bra debut in Las Vegas on November 13, 2014.Paris Hilton hit the red carpet at the NRJ DJ Awards at Grimaldi Forum on November 12, 2014 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.Olivia Wilde hit the red carpet at UK Premiere of 'Horrible Bosses 2' at Odeon West End on November 12, 2014 in London, England.Taylor Swift ran errands in NYC on Nov. 12.LJennifer Lawrence attended an after party following the World Premiere of 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1' at Victoria House on November 10, 2014 in London, England.Brooke Shields enjoyed a laugh beachside at the IBEROSTAR Playa Mita in Riviera Nayarit, Mexico on Nov. 10.Kim Kardashian and Kanye West leave Cipriani in NYC on Nov. 7.Victoria Beckham arrived at Gare du Nord from London for a one-day trip to Paris.
