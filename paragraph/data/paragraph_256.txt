(OPIC).TURN ON THE LIGHTS"It's absolutely not true. Power Africa is an opportunity to  turn on the lights for millions of Africans by taking investment  from all over the world," Herscowitz said.The NextGen project website, however, says a power purchase  agreement for the solar project was signed in January 2013, six  months before Power Africa was launched.In addition, the investment banks EXIM and OPIC are fighting  for their survival in Congress, where Obama's Democratic Party  was severely weakened in mid-term elections this month.In a change of tack, the U.S. government said this month it  wants to partner with China on improving power in Africa.Meanwhile, corruption in the countries that Power Africa  operates in remains a problem.President Barack Obama meets with Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez at the G20 Summit in Cannes, France, Friday, Nov. 4, 2011.
