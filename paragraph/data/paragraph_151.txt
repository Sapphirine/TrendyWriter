They were looking right at us saying, ‘Choose me,’” Laura said during a phone interview.For Rosalba, adopting was always the way she saw herself starting a family. “To me, family means having someone who loves you unconditionally regardless of blood,” she said.“I felt like I had lost my own child, in a sense,” Laura said. “I had to go through a grieving period and that’s when I became open to adopting.”Determined to form a family together, the couple sought resources through the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. DCFS didn’t make their sexuality an issue.“There were individuals who were ignorant and vocal about their thoughts and made us feel uncomfortable,” said Rosalba, “but it was a negative experience that turned positive.”The couple never planned on adopting three children at once, but they felt a strong connection to the brothers.“The boys weren’t saying, ‘Our moms are getting married.’ They kept referring to it as ‘our wedding.’ It was like together we were all celebrating becoming a family,” Rosalba recalled.Pair battling Michigan gay marriage ban adopt 4th childSPECIAL REPORT: What Virginia law means for gay couples wanting to adoptAdoption to the fore in gay marriage debateItaly's top court to rule on gay adoptionCBS' 'Home for the Holidays' Adoption Special to Feature 1st Gay Couple'Two and a Half Men' recap: 'Gay' newlyweds are approved for adoptionDetroit nurses challenging Michigan gay marriage ban adopt 4th childApartment Adoption Project starts for homeless Chicago youth
