"We're trying to let everybody know if we come together as a people and unite, we can change it."Finally, squads of police boxed in and began arresting around 60 remaining protesters for failure to disperse, Neiman said.Earlier Wednesday, nine people were arrested after they sat down in a bus lane on U.S. 101 near downtown during one of the busiest driving days of the year.There were smaller, peaceful protests in other communities, including San Diego and Riverside.More than 300 protesters have been arrested over the past three days by Los Angeles police and California Highway Patrol officers.Kristin J.
