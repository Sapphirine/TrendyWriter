Bill O'Reilly Weighs In On Ferguson Protests, Grand Jury Decision

We know, we know. You weren't 100 percent sure what to make of the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, until you heard what Bill O'Reilly had to say about it.

Luckily, the Fox News host gave his two cents on the matter Wednesday night on "The Tonight Show," telling viewers what he thought of the grand jury's decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson.

"You have to accept it," he told host Jimmy Fallon. "I mean that's our system. You have to accept it."

O'Reilly went on to analyze the "emotional" state of African Americans, adding that he understands and respects the use of protests to a certain extent.

"Things don't change in this country unless you protest," he said. "They don't get better unless you protest. So we want that ... But don't burn down somebody's store."
