Ex-CBC Host Jian Ghomeshi Charged With Sexual Assault

Former CBC radio host Jian Ghomeshi has been charged with four counts of sexual assault and one count of "overcome resistance -- choking," CBC News reported Wednesday.

Ghomeshi, 47, appeared in court Wednesday afternoon and was released on $100,000 bail, according to the Toronto Star. Conditions of his release also included the surrender of his passport, that he live with his mother, and that he not leave Ontario.

Following Ghomeshi's bail hearing, his lawyer, Marie Henein, gave a brief statement.

"Mr. Ghomeshi will be pleading not guilty," Henein said, adding that neither she nor Ghomeshi would be making any further media statements. "We will address these allegations fully and directly in a courtroom. It is not my practice to litigate my cases in the media."
