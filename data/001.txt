Thanksgiving 2014: What Media Personalities Are Thankful For

As is tradition, The Huffington Post has asked some of the biggest names in media what they were most grateful for this year. The list ranges from the standard (friends, family and health), to the not so standard (coconut champagne, Taco Bell and Spanx), and everything in between (Taylor Swift).
And we at HuffPost Media are thankful, of course, to all the anchors, correspondents and commentators around the globe who keep us gainfully employed by giving us something to write about each day.
Happy Thanksgiving!
“This year, I’m thankful for my home family’s patience and love, and for my work family’s forbearance, sense of humor, tirelessness and brilliance. I’m also thankful for the continued willingness of communities and individuals to struggle out from the margins, and to stand up for justice, freedom and fairness, anywhere around the world.”
