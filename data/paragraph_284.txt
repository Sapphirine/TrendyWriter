Fox News chief White House correspondent Ed Henry pushed White House press secretary Josh Earnest Monday to respond toa recent New York Times reportabout Al Sharpton's unpaid taxes.The Times piece, published Tuesday, claimed that the MSNBC host has a "troubling financial past," with some $4.5 million in state and federal tax liens currently against him."Mr. Sharpton has regularly sidestepped the sorts of obligations most people see as inevitable, like taxes, rent and other bills," Times investigative reporter Russ Buettner wrote.Here's how the exchange went down:Henry: Is the White House concerned that he hasn't paid his taxes?Henry: But an advisor to the president should pay his or her taxes?Earnest: I think every American should pay his or her taxes. Controversial statement for a Monday.
